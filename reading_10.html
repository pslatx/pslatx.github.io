      <h1>Socialism and the legacy of the Soviet Union</h1>

      <hr>
      <p><i>This 2008 article can be found in the 2017 book "Storming the Gates: How the Russian Revolution Changed the World (Liberation Media)." This book is available for purchase at store.psl.web.</i></p>
      <p>The single biggest event that shaped global politics in the 20th century was the Russian Revolution of 1917, which gave birth to the Soviet Union. The ﬁrst socialist government's existence was the pivot for world events in history's most turbulent and dynamic century. The destruction of the Soviet Union 74 years later in 1991 has been the dominant factor shaping global politics in the nearly 17 years since.</p>
      <p>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels wrote in 1848, "A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of communism." However haunting the specter of communism may have appeared to the European bourgeoisie in the mid-1800s, it would seem mild compared to the undiluted hysteria directed by all the imperialist powers and old ruling classes against the actually-existing Soviet Union throughout the 20th century.</p>
      <p>The victory of the Russian Revolution transformed the presentation of communism from an idea or an ideology into a living, breathing social and political experience. It was an attempt to consciously build a society based on the interests and needs of the working classes.</p>
      <p>Communism's new identiﬁcation with a state power was extremely positive for the world communist movement. The domestic programs, the radical reorganization of constitutional law and the revolutionary foreign policy of the new Soviet state spread the appeal of communism to nearly every corner of the globe. Millions of people were drawn into political life and the communist movement as the idea of workers' power took on ﬂesh and bones.</p>
      <p>In the colonized world, the Soviet message of self-determination and freedom drew the most advanced youth directly into newly founded communist parties. From China to Vietnam to South Africa, the banner of Soviet communism became synonymous not just with socialism but with the aspirations for national independence.</p>
      <p>As the inﬂuence of communism spread throughout the 20th century to all corners of the world, every capitalist power brought to bear the weight of its media, politicians, universities and especially armies in a global struggle to counter Soviet inﬂuence.</p>
      <p>The identiﬁcation of communism with a state power expanded later to its political association with the governments in Eastern Europe, China, North Korea, Vietnam and Cuba, along with newly founded revolutionary governments in Africa that were also trying to take a socialist road. Communism became inseparably connected to what was known as the "socialist bloc" governments. As the ﬁrst, largest and most powerful socialist power, the Soviet Union was identiﬁed as the anchor of this global camp.</p>
      <section id="a1s1">
        <h2>POLITICS, IDEOLOGY AND STATE POWER</h2>
        <p>Conﬂating the historical ideology and perspective of communism with a government or a bloc of governments also created a tremendous disadvantage, in spite of the material advantages that came from possessing state power. Every setback, weakness, retreat, defect and deformation suﬀered by the Soviet Union was also identiﬁed as an inherent negative feature of communism.</p>
        <p>That the socialist revolutions took place in poor countries instead of the rich imperialist countries gave the capitalist propaganda machine ready-made ammunition to argue against socialism. Anti-communist literature could point to the relative aﬄuence of the imperialist countries and assert, "Socialism or communism is nothing but the equality of poverty for the people while 'officials' and 'bureaucrats' enjoy privileges based on their association with the ruling communist party."</p>
        <p>This same anti-communist propaganda, spoon-fed to the people of the United States, obscured and falsiﬁed every real social and economic achievement made by the Soviet Union, China or Cuba. Nowhere was it mentioned that every Soviet worker had a legal right to a job, free health care and free child care. Rent was a small fraction of income. Every worker was guaranteed one month of paid vacation.</p>
        <p>These social rights were maligned or hidden in the West. In every instance, the propaganda emphasized that the capitalist United States was rich and aﬄuent, with ordinary workers having access to all sorts of goods and services that were not accessible in the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>When the Soviet Union was overthrown in 1991, capitalist propaganda highlighted one theme: The collapse of the Soviet Union meant that communism itself was now dead. The dream of poor and working people was vanquished forever. "The end of history," was the theme of a best seller in 1992 written by academic Francis Fukuyama. The essence of this argument was that capitalism and the rule by a class of billionaires of and over society was the natural order of things.</p>

        <h2>NO ANTI-COMMUNIST UPRISING</h2>
        <p>The Soviet Union was not overthrown by foreign military intervention. Nor was it brought down by an uprising of discontented workers as happened with the October 1917 revolution. In fact, nine months before its dissolution, 77 percent of the people in the Soviet Union voted to maintain the country in a referendum taken as part of the March 1991 election.</p>
        <p>That result did not interest the pro-capitalist "democrats" in the least. In December 1991, the leaders began the process that would see the USSR dissolved within the next year.</p>
        <p>It was leaders from within the summits of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that led the oﬀensive to destroy the Communist Party and dismantle the Soviet Union. This initiated the sale and looting of publicly owned factories, real estate, oil, gas and mining enterprises; and collectively owned agricultural lands and farms.</p>
        <p>The wealth of society—at least signiﬁcant parts of it—was turned over to a new class of private capitalists who soon became notorious for their opulence, decadence and theft. The legal social status of the working class was diminished and the standard of living of almost all workers plummeted.</p>
        <p>The loss of factory jobs and access to medical care coupled with the attendant social problems and demoralization led to disastrous consequences. For example, a March 11, 1998, article in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported a drop in life expectancy for Soviet males from 63.8 years in 1990 to 57.7 years in 1994. The population in Russia actually dropped by over 500,000 people in the ﬁrst eight months of 2000—the steepest drop ever during peacetime.</p>
        <p>All the while, U.S. propaganda proclaimed that democracy and freedom had come at last to Russia.</p>

      <section id="a1s3">
        <h2>A REVOLUTION LIKE NO OTHER</h2>
        <p>The Russian Revolution marked the ﬁrst time in human history that the working classes, those without property, took the reins of power and held them. All previous revolutions in human history had transferred social and political power from one class of elite property owners to another.</p>   
        <p>The great French Revolution of 1789-93, for instance, had destroyed the power of the monarchy, feudal lords, landed nobility and aristocracy. The working classes had been the vanguard ﬁghters in that revolution. But that revolution led to the French bourgeoisie taking power. The feudal mechanisms of exploitation based on serfdom were uprooted and destroyed, but were replaced by a new system of exploitation based on wage labor or wage slavery.</p>
        <p>The October 1917 insurrection was altogether diﬀerent from earlier revolutions. The social aims of the revolution, led by workers and poor farmers or peasants, were explicit about their class content.</p>
        <p>Earlier revolutions masked their class character with broad slogans of freedom and equality "for all." The Russian Revolution, by contrast, explicitly proclaimed that eliminating all exploitation of the laboring classes was its principal objective on the road to achieving a society without classes. Operating under the Marxist conception that society was divided into antagonistic classes driven by mutual and irreconcilable diﬀerences, the explicit goal of the revolution was to achieve the political and social supremacy of the working classes over their former exploiters.</p>
        <p>The banal slogan of "liberty and justice for all" was considered a mask concealing the true picture that the rich and privileged owners of private property had dominated society.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s4">
        <h2>A WORKERS' CONSTITUTION</h2>
        <p>The victory of the Russian Revolution was based on the soviets—workers' councils that were the basic ﬁghting organizations of the Russian workers. After the revolution, the soviets became the basic units of government. The ﬁrst constitution adopted by the Congress of Soviets on July 10, 1918, set out the "fundamental goal" as "suppressing all human</p>
        <p>exploitation, abolishing forever the division of society into classes, ruthlessly suppressing all exploiters, bringing about the socialist organization of society and the triumph of socialism in all countries."</p>
        <p>None of the victorious revolutionary bourgeois governments from earlier epochs, even in their most revolutionary phases, would have thought of declaring this "fundamental goal" in their constitutions.</p>
        <p>"As a ﬁrst step toward the complete transfer of factories, works, shops, mines, railways and other means of production and of transport to the ownership of the workers' and peasants' Soviet Republic and to insure the supremacy of the laboring masses over the exploiters, the Congress ratiﬁes the Soviet law on workers control of industry," reads another key provision in the constitution.</p>
        <p>Anticipating that the resistance of the overthrown exploiters would be greater following the revolution and that they would be aided by the imperialist governments of the world, the constitution declared that, "In order to secure the supremacy of the laboring masses and to guard against any possibility of the restoration of the power of the exploiters, the Congress declares the arming of the laboring population."3</p>
        <p>This clause might have seemed to be written by people with a crystal ball. Within months after the 1918 Constitution was adopted, the country was plunged into a bloody civil war pitting class against class. Fourteen imperialist armies, including the United States, invaded Russia between 1918 and 1920. Three million people died.</p>
        <p>And yet, to the amazement of all, the new workers' state survived the onslaught.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s5">
        <h2>PROBLEMS OF SOCIALIST DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <p>A huge part of the politicized and consciously communist working class of Russia died as volunteers ﬁghting for the new social order, however. By the close of the civil war, the cities were decimated by hunger and disease. The factories were without raw materials. The urban proletariat started to return to the countryside in search of food.</p>
        <p>The economy had contracted by nearly 90 percent compared to the 1914 pre-World War I level. In order to resume production, Lenin and the Russian communists retreated in 1921 and allowed the return of capitalism and capitalists—but under the "supervision" of the Soviet state. The New Economic Policy was presented as an emergency step away from the</p>
        <p>communists' goals—to bend so as not to break. While it did stimulate production in both the countryside and the cities, it also led to a re-polarization of social classes, especially in the countryside.</p>
        <p>It was not until 1928, when the economy was getting back on its feet, that the Soviet government resumed the push toward rapid socialization in the factories and the countryside.</p>
        <p>In spite of these difficulties—all amid severe economic sanctions and blockade by the imperialists—the Soviet Union grew into the second largest economy in the world. Old, backward Russia entered the modern world using socialist methods of public ownership and central economic planning. It went from semi-feudalism in 1917 to a position where it launched the space age, putting the ﬁrst spacecraft into orbit in 1957.</p>
        <p>The Soviet people were among the most educated and cultured in the world. They accomplished in decades what had taken centuries to achieve in capitalist Europe.</p>
        <p>For the most underdeveloped Soviet Republics in Central Asia and the Caucuses, the rate of economic and social development was even greater than that of Russia, although they still lagged behind. The Soviet Union's policies of prioritizing economic and social development in those regions were in eﬀect the largest affirmative-action program in history.</p>
        <p>In 1940, Hitler tried to re-impose capitalism in the Soviet Union by military force. Twenty-seven million Soviets died repelling and defeating fascism and liberating eastern and central Europe from the yoke of Nazi occupation. The Soviets never had a moment of reprieve following that awful carnage that devoured not only lives but the Soviet economic achievements of an entire post-revolutionary generation.</p>
        <p>The Cold War with the United States—which began even before World War II had ended—required a massive diversion of funds from the civilian economy to the Soviet military. Despite these setbacks and non-stop drain on resources, the Soviet economy grew quickly using socialist methods.</p>      
      </section>
      <section id="a1s6">
        <h2>BEHIND GORBACHEV'S RETREAT</h2>
        <p>The eventual overthrow of the Soviet Union was not caused by economic catastrophe. The growth rate in the economy had indeed slowed by the late 1970s. The high-tech revolution that led to an across-the-board restructuring of the industrial societies in Western Europe and the United States did in fact highlight a structural problem unique to the Soviet economic system.</p>
        <p>The widespread transfer of the newest technologies in computers and electronics into industrial production in the western capitalist powers allowed for a major contraction of the work force. Millions of industrial workers in capitalist societies lost their jobs.</p>
        <p>In the Soviet Union, a job was a right and the government was not legally entitled to deprive workers of employment. A careful process of job training and re-location for all workers whose jobs had become redundant slowed the pace of the introduction of the new technologies. Neither Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, nor the captains of industry, experienced these inhibitions.</p>
        <p>This structural issue came on top of the enduring problem caused by the anti-communist economic blockade that prevented any transfer to the Soviet Union of technology that was revolutionizing the means of production in the advanced capitalist societies.</p>
        <p>Gorbachev's economic reforms known as "perestroika" were intended to use market competition as a way to end or radically diminish the Soviet government's obligations to the working class. Market forces, rather than the enshrined legal rights of the working class, would determine employment patterns.</p>
        <p>This section of the Soviet bureaucracy represented by Gorbachev identiﬁed socialist property relations and the Soviet Union's isolation from the locomotive of the world economy as the central obstacles impeding the country from sharing in the fruits of the revolution in technology that was sweeping the world in the last quarter of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>Gorbachev and the Soviet reformers were convinced that only by ending the Cold War and liquidating centralized economic planning would U.S. imperialism accept the Soviet Union's entry into the rapidly accelerating model of a global economy.</p>
        <p>Instead, the reforms set forces into motion inside and outside of the Soviet Communist Party who were completely bourgeois and pro-imperialist in their orientation. The pre-existing Soviet political system had driven them underground or into the Communist Party itself.</p>
        <p>This relatively narrow stratum, as it struggled to de-legitimize and end Soviet power, did not promise the workers that they were about to loot their factories and society's wealth. They carried out the destruction of the existing government instead with a promise of ending corruption and bureaucratic abuse and bringing an end to the Cold War, which in turn would allow the people to enjoy the fruits of the world economy.</p>
        <p>The 1917 Russian Revolution transformed private capitalist property into public property. That raised the possibility for the transition to socialism—but it hardly settled the question. It is evident by the overthrow of the socialist government that classes and class struggle do not disappear but take new forms during the post-capitalist period.</p>
        <p>Pro-capitalist propaganda paints the high point of the 20th century as the "end of communism." Partisans of the working class and those who yearn for genuine equality will remember the Soviet Union not as the end of communism but as its ﬁrst grand, real-life experiment. Its strengths and weaknesses will be assessed and incorporated by all future generations as invaluable lessons in the struggle to replace capitalist brutality, unemployment and poverty with a rational system that organizes and distributes the bounty of the world economy to meet the needs of human beings.</p>

      <h1>The importance of the 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">October 2017</div>
      <div class="author">Brian Becker</div>
      <hr>
      <p><i>This 2017 article can also be found in the 2017 book Storming the Gates: How the Russian Revolution Changed the World (Liberation Media), available for purchase at store.psl.web.</i></p>
      <p>It is a requirement of every socialist to have a position on the Soviet Union. What was its class character? How could it accomplish so much? How could a country that was a latecomer to industrialization and saddled by a largely backward peasant-based economy tempestuously industrialize in the shortest possible time becoming the second largest economic and military power within a few decades and then a few decades later come apart, politically implode, unravel and disappear?</p>
      <p>Born out of two revolutions in 1917 and a bloody three-year civil war that followed, the rise and fall of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics changed the course of world politics in the 20 th century. Conversely, the absence of the Soviet Union as a counterweight to a U.S.-led imperialist world has shaped the ﬁrst part of the 21 st century as well.
      The seizure of power by the Bolsheviks created a government whose foreign policy was unlike any other. Its initial pronouncements indicated just how diﬀerent it was: It denounced imperialism, affirmed the rights of colonial peoples to throw oﬀ the shackles of foreign domination, and proclaimed that this revolution in "backward" Russia was nothing less than the ﬁrst shot in a worldwide socialist revolution against the capitalist and imperialist ruling classes of the world.</p>
      <p>The eﬀect was immediate and electrifying. To the "global east" and "global south," young freedom ﬁghters suddenly embraced communism and Bolshevism and formed new communist parties to lead their struggles for national independence and self-determination.</p>
      <p>In the "global west" the socialist movement split into two camps: communism on the one hand and social democracy on the other. Mass communist parties took shape throughout the centers of advanced capitalism - from Europe to Japan and even the United States.
      In the camp of the imperialist countries the Bolshevik-led revolution created a panic of an unprecedented nature. Fourteen imperial armies invaded Russia to ﬁght alongside reactionary "White" armies led by former czarist commanders and reactionaries. The ﬁrst "Red Scare" was unleashed against leftists and against Black radicals throughout the United States. Thousands of leftists were arrested in the Palmer Raids in 1919-20, an operation led by 24-year old J. Edgar Hoover. Many socialist, anarchist and communist immigrants were summarily deported.</p>
      <section id="a2s1">
        <h2>THE FIRST OF ITS KIND</h2>
        <p>The Russian Revolution was unique. It was the ﬁrst time in world history that a non-property- owning, working class seized political power and held on to it.</p>
        <p>In the American Revolution and French Revolution of the 18 th century, the transfer of political power, i.e., the seizure of the state power, was from one group of private property owners and exploiters to another.</p>
        <p>Invasions, revolutions, coups, conspiracies and assassinations have through the millennia resulted in the violent seizure of political power by one group or another. In every instance, their political power was wielded on behalf of a group of property-owning exploiter classes.
        The Russian Revolution was diﬀerent. The power was seized by revolutionaries who proclaimed their adherence to socialism and communism. They insisted that their goal was the eradication of any private property-owning ruling class. This was to be a revolution on behalf of those who owned no property but rather lived by the sale of their labor power. Ruling classes everywhere understood the implications of this contagion spreading.</p>       
      </section>
      <section id="a2s2">
        <h2>A REVOLUTION BASED ON TWO CLASSES</h2>
        <p>There was one very large caveat in this picture. Most of the people in Russia were not urban, proletarian workers who fed themselves and their families from income derived from wage labor.</p>
        <p>Rather, 75 percent of the country's people were farmers, peasants who worked the land. While many were landless, millions owned small tracts of lands; middle peasants owned a bit more land and the kulaks, a relatively aﬄuent farming strata, largely dominated the political and cultural life of rural Russia.</p>
        <p>The Russian Revolution of 1917 was the consequence of an alliance between the wage-owning propertyless urban working class and the large peasant mass that saw in the revolution, not the eradication of their private property, but rather their ability to seize the property that
        they worked on but which belonged to the large landed estates and landlords.</p>
        <p>It was czarist Russia's catastrophic involvement in World War I that drove hungry, land-starved peasants into violent, revolutionary action in 1917 against the landed estates of the Russian aristocracy at the very same time the urban working class came under the leadership of Lenin and the Bolsheviks.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a2s3">
        <h2>INDUSTRIALIZATION, COLLECTIVIZATION AND A NEW WORLD WAR</h2>
        <p>The capitalist class in the urban areas was disposed of its property. Later, in the 1930s, the Soviet government launched a massive collectivization and industrialization campaign, that radically changed property relations in the vast Russian peasant countryside. The socialist revolution of November 7, 1917 was a nearly bloodless aﬀair. The collectivization of the 1930s was nothing short of a civil war. The ﬁghting and the ensuing famine that lasted from
          1929-1935 took a heavy toll on people, livestock and agricultural production.</p>
          <p>Industrialization in the main centers of capitalism was a process that had taken more than a century. But the leaders of the Soviet Union recognized and acted on the urgent need to rapidly transform the country from a rural, small-scale, private peasant farm economy to an industrial power capable of competing in all areas with the capitalist west.</p>
          <p>The tempestuous all-out pace of collectivization and industrialization was a point of huge debate and created widespread turmoil inside the country and within the Communist party of the Soviet Union. The 1930s were a wrenching decade. Tens of millions of peasants poured into the cities and took their place in the grueling work of the industrial factory. The small land plots of millions of peasants were aggregated into larger collective farms with the goal of introducing large-scale farming techniques, mechanization, the replacement of farm animals with tractors, the use of industrial fertilizers and other modern farming methods that were impossible as long as the land was divided into tiny, privately- owned plots.</p>
          <p>On June 22, 1941, the largest part of the German war machine invaded the Soviet Union. It was a surprise attack shattering the end of the German-Soviet non-aggression agreement. This was a pivotal moment in the twentieth century. Eighty percent of Germany's military division swept east into the Soviet Union. German military units crashed through the Soviet military lines and encircled hundreds of thousands of troops, while the German Luftwaﬀe destroyed a</p>
          <p>signiﬁcant part of the Soviet air force on the ground. By the end of the war 27 million people in the Soviet Union had died. To understand the staggering character of this toll one need only compare it to the casualties of the United States (419,000) and Britain (450,000).</p>
          <p>Hitler, like the other imperialist politicians in the west, including Roosevelt and Churchill, fully underestimated both the industrial and thus the military capacity of the Soviet Union, not to mention the heroic determination and resolve of the Soviet people to resist. It was the Soviet Union that smashed Nazism. It was the Soviet counter-oﬀensive westward that began in 1944 that liberated the peoples of eastern and central Europe from the scourge of fascism, liberated the concentration camps and led to the collapse of the Hitler -regime. In fact, the United States and the British only opened up the Western Front of the war against Germany in 1944 when it became evident that the Soviet counter-oﬀensive would otherwise leave the Red Army as the sole force to liberate all of Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Despite the hardships and cruelties that accompanied the mad dash to industrialization in the 1930s, it is beyond dispute that the creation of Soviet industry was indispensable in the military struggle to defeat the German war machine. This industrial drive was carried out by the state. The factories were public property. The "proﬁts" from state enterprises were used to plan and fund additional production according to state planning, not hoarded by a fabulously wealthy class of capitalist owners.</p>
          <p>The Soviet leadership had always dealt with the question of how to technologically "keep up" with the West. This was both a national security and a political imperative, as socialism was prized as being a higher stage of human development.</p>
          <p>Indeed, having nationalized and socialized all the basic sectors of the economy, utilizing a centrally planned economy and iron discipline, the government achieved remarkable economic feats. The economy was rapidly industrialized, which allowed the country to defeat the Nazi invaders. After the war, it was then rebuilt from the ashes with remarkable speed and by the late 1950s and early 1960s had even begun to match and surpass the West's most advanced scientiﬁc achievements.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a2s4">
        <h2>THE COLD WAR: TWO SOCIAL SYSTEMS IN GLOBAL CONFLICT</h2>
        <p>Although the goal of the Soviet leadership in the aftermath of the defeat of fascism was to peacefully coexist with their war times allies Britain and the United States, the imperialist governments treated the Soviet Union and other socialist governments as a mortal enemy.</p>
        <p>One must understand the genesis of the Cold War. The sheer magnitude of the violence of the second world war led to the collapse of the existing world imperialist/colonial systems. National liberation movements and socialist revolutions swept Asia. Anti-colonial movements in the Middle East and Africa were on the march. Communist movements were getting stronger throughout the global South and East. The communist parties in France and Italy and Greece were the dominant political organizations in society and the Soviet Red Army remained in the countries that it had liberated from fascism in much of eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>The relationship of forces between the Soviet Union and world imperialism shifted dramatically in the decade immediately following World War II. The USSR was no longer the only socialist government. In China too the communists came to power in 1949 following an epic 27-year long armed struggle. Communists took the power in the northern half of Korea and in the northern half of Vietnam. If it had not been for the partition of the two countries as a post war arrangement between the Soviet Union and the United States, all of Korea and Vietnam would have been under the control of communist forces led by Kim il Sung and Ho Chi Minh respectively.</p>
        <p>The Soviet leadership made these concessions because they were hoping to come to a peaceful arrangement with the United States and Britain following the war. The Soviet goal was to avoid another war. But the intensifying confrontational position of U.S. and British imperialism in the face of the global sweep of revolutionary movements led to a full scale imperialist counter-attack. The revolution in China in 1949 followed by the wars in Korea; Vietnam; the civil war in Greece; the Berlin crisis of 1948 and the constant covert war to overthrow the socialist governments in Europe for the next three decades; the CIA coups from Iran to Guatemala to the Congo to Indonesia; the U.S. and British invasion of Lebanon and Kuwait following Iraq's revolution in 1958; the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and the subsequent blockade; Israel's seizure of the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan Heights and the Sinai in 1967; U.S. support for Portuguese fascism's war against the national liberation movements in Angola, Guinea Bissau and Mozambique; US support of the racist, apartheid system in South Africa; were just some ﬂashpoints of the global class struggle.</p>

        <h2>WHAT MADE THE USSR VULNERABLE</h2>
        <p>Despite all the of the international challenges and and economic problems caused by perennial labor shortages, imbalances between town and country, overspending on military, lack of access to global technologies and other extreme pressures imposed by pace of economic growth there remained within the Soviet leadership a high conﬁdence in the socialist system.
          There were three areas of particular vulnerability, however, that deeply aﬀected the Soviet</p>
          <p>leadership, and its overall conﬁdence, especially as it transitioned to a new political grouping that came of age in the middle of the Cold War.</p>
          <p>First, the Soviets lost their technological edge as the new high tech revolution in computers and electronics which took place ﬁrst in the western capitalist countries and Japan started in the 1970s. The Soviets were completely blockaded from importing new technology from the capitalist west.</p>
          <p>Second, at the same time, the U.S. government took advantage of the political conﬂict between the two largest socialist countries to play them oﬀ each other and to ultimately enter into an anti-Soviet alliance with the People's Republic of China. China was allowed to integrate into the world capitalist economy thus achieving access to the latest technologies emanating from the imperialist-led countries in what we call the high tech revolution.</p>
          <p>Third, the socialist governments of Eastern Europe were inherently weakened since they were not the by-product of authentic revolutions of the people but rather the consequence of the Soviet Red Army's presence following the defeat of fascism. The decision by the USSR to proceed with the socialization of the countries of eastern Europe came about later in the 1940s after it became clear that the United States and Britain were rejecting a path favored by the Soviet leadership which was to create "neutral" governments in the territories that bordered the USSR's western ﬂank.</p>      
          <p>Thus, revolutions from the top in countries that had been dominated by fascism a few years earlier created an uncertain political situation. Right wing political forces didn't vanish but they were not permitted to operate openly.The exception in this process is in Eastern Europe, of course, was Yugoslavia where the communist-led partisan army under the leadership of Tito defeated German imperialism and proceeded to create a government.</p>
          <p>In the two decades following the close of World War II, and in the context of the sharpening global confrontation, the Soviet economy continued to grow steadily but with many problems.</p>
          <p>There were constant eﬀorts to innovate; new economic reforms were proposed with the goal of overcoming contradictions and imbalances in a planned economy suﬀering from the eﬀects of being isolated from trade and exchange with the leading centers of the industrialized world.
          A constant theme by the 1960s was how to improve the production of consumer goods when the economic model and scarce resources continued to favor industry and the production of military goods. Big problems in agriculture were a regular theme of internal debates and political struggles. By the mid-1970s the Soviet economy began to slow. Its annual growth rate</p>
          <p>continued to be positive rather than negative (recession) but the rate of growth was clearly stalling and going backwards.</p>
          <p>The economic situation continued to deteriorate during the 1980s. The notion sunk in that the country had decisively fallen behind and would be isolated from the huge leaps forward taking place around them in the capitalist countries. How the Soviet Union could keep up with the new developments in technology--in computers, electronics, automation--appeared not only as an economic issue but went straight to the existential questions of national security.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the Soviet leadership looked enviously at China's sudden and dynamic economic growth. There was a strong sense that the People's Republic of China was gaining economically and technologically from its reintegration into the world capitalist economy while the Soviet Union's economy was experiencing stagnation. China had cast oﬀ its leftist, revolutionary orientation of the Mao era, entered into an anti-Soviet alliance with U.S. imperialism, allowed capitalist property relations to be partly restored and was thus beneﬁting from huge new foreign direct investment by the leading capitalist corporations in the west and Japan.</p>
          <p>The 1980s witnessed a shocking internal crisis in the summits of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After numerous short-lived changes in the top leadership of the old guard of the CPSU and the Soviet government in the ﬁrst half of the 1980s, a new generation of leadership took the helm in 1985. Within six years the entire ediﬁce of the political leadership broke apart. Hastily adopted economic reforms, instead of solving structural problems, drove the economy into the ground. Nascent bourgeois political, ideological and economic forces that had existed in the shadows emerged to vie for power and to privatize public property. Anti-communist ideologues took control of important media outlets. Throughout the governments of Eastern Europe, pro-capitalist elements seized leadership and helped bring down already divided governments.</p>
          <p>Inside the USSR a dynamic counterrevolutionary thrust was met with passivity and confusion by what appeared to be an ossiﬁed political institution. The Communist Party was declared illegal in 1990 as counter-revolutionary Boris Yeltsin suddenly rose to power in Russia. By January 1992 the Soviet Union, a multinational state comprised of 15 republics, went out of existence. Each of the 15 republics became independent.</p>
          <p>A near counter-revolution also took place in China at nearly the same time. The Communist Party of China's policy of alliance with western imperialism led to a major division within the</p>
          <p>Party as well as a grassroots pro-capitalist uprising among privileged nascent bourgeois among some students. Deng Xio Peng and other leaders of the Chinese Communist party thus moved to use People's Liberation Army in June 1989 to clear the seven-week long counter- revolutionary occupation of Tien An Men Square.</p>
          <p>This decisive action, which was denounced by all the centers of imperialism and falsely caricatured as the "Tiananmen massacre" prevented China from going down the same road of counter-revolution that overthrew the USSR or the governments of Eastern Europe. Although Deng and his faction had inaugurated many of the pro-capitalist reforms in China that inadvertently birthed this new bourgeois student movement, the same CCP leadership was deeply connected to the original revolution. They had helped lead the long armed struggle. They were not about to stand by and watch while reactionaries and imperialism coordinated the endeavor to seize power from the CCP.</p>

        <h2>TWO COUNTER-REVOLUTIONS: THE DEFEAT OF THE PARIS COMMUNE AND THE OVERTHROW OF SOVIET POWER</h2>
        <p>The collapse the USSR, the ignominious overthrow of the second most powerful country in the world was not the consequence of an invasion, a civil war, a military coup or a natural disaster. There were some street mobilizations but no long lasting barricades, nor prolonged ﬁghting in the streets. Unlike in China, the Party split apart.</p>
        <p>Fidel Castro said that the demise of the USSR was the greatest single defeat in the history of the working class.</p>
        <p>That event was the biggest historic defeat for the worldwide working class not only because of its immediate political and economic impact. The character and form of the defeat had a particularly demoralizing and dissipating eﬀect on the worldwide movement for socialism and communism.</p>    
        <p>The defeat of the Paris Commune in 1871 was also a grievous, historic defeat for the working class. The Commune was the ﬁrst time that the working class had taken control of state power. Within a few months the Commune was crushed in a bloody massacre. But the communards went down ﬁghting. Tens of thousands died. Their heroism in defeat became a symbol of resistance and an inspiration for future communards in Russia, China and everywhere.</p>
        <p>The overthrow of Soviet socialism oﬀered no such example of heroic ﬁghting to defend the ﬁrst workers state. The struggle between those who wanted to retain the system and those who</p>
        <p>wanted to restore capitalism and integrate the country into the world capitalist economy was largely played out in a confusing struggle between factions within the summits of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The working class in large measure remained passively on the sidelines watching, functioning as spectators while the "leaders" and the media, which had been captured by anti-communists, battled with each other.</p>
        <p>The failure of the working class to intervene at this moment of crisis was a clear indicator of something wrong, but it was not that the people desired to privatize their workplaces and hand the economy over to billionaire oligarchs, as the capitalist media claimed. Confusion, passivity and inertness was the dominant trend. The absence of widespread working class resistance to the counter-revolution indicated the extent to which the early ﬂame of independent political activism had been extinguished.</p>
        <p>Over the decades the working class had watched on as the leaders in the CPSU made the political decisions. The party was presented as the repository of political knowledge, its apparatus was "the" legacy of the revolution itself, its decisions were "correct" and thus its deliberations had over time come to supplant and then extinguish the independent working- class activism that had given the 1917 revolution its energy, emancipatory dynamism and heroic self-sacriﬁce. Those were the key to the revolution's survival during the ﬁrst eﬀorts at counterrevolution, when the young socialist country was targeted by the invasion of 14 imperialist armies of imperialists ﬁghting alongside other counter-revolutionary armies and militias.</p>

        <h2>THE DECISIVE ROLE OF LEADERSHIP</h2>
        <p>One need only look at the writings, debates, controversies and political struggles inside of Russia during the ﬁrst ten years after the 1917 revolution to grasp how democratic, engaging and energizing the impact of the revolution was on the working class. Without a doubt the working class in Russia was the most politicized in the world.</p>
        <p>The frankness and openness about the problems facing society, the government, the economy and the party are evident in every one of Lenin's speeches and writings right up until he was completely debilitated by a devastating stroke in January 1923.</p>
        <p>The leadership and the party talked openly about all the challenges, shortcomings and weaknesses of the process that they were pursuing in trying to build socialism in a country that was ravaged by hunger, famine, illiteracy, invasions, civil war and a complete economic blockade from the centers of the world economy.</p>
        <p>This style of leadership had the eﬀect of engaging and catalyzing the revolutionary energy of the working class so that they could overcome and survive what seemed to be overwhelming odds.</p>
        <p>All socialists and communists who want to understand the unique leadership style of the Bolsheviks under the tutelage of Lenin need to read and study his speeches and reports to the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th , and 11th Congresses of the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik) that took place between 1918-1922.</p>
        <p>These interventions by Lenin demonstrated candor, frankness and openness about the problems and weaknesses of the communists and their government, combining an unshakable will and boundless determination with extreme ﬂexibility in tactics. As with all revolutions the leadership was young, vibrant and bold. In 1917 Lenin, 46, was known by his nickname "the old man." The average age of attendees at the Party Congress in 1917 was 29. In a survey taken a decade before the revolution, 60 percent of the Bolshevik membership was 24 years old or younger, and one of every ﬁve was a teenager.</p>
        <p>Six decades later the composition of the party leadership was diﬀerent in many ways. They were far older and importantly not at all connected as personal participants in the 1917 revolution. Rather they were politicians and managers who had ascended as a consequence of their administrative, political and management achievements or through seniority with the party or state bureaucracy. The party was led in 1980 by Leonid Brezhnev, who was then severely ill and nearly incapacitated. He died in 1982 and was replaced by Yuri Andropov, a 68-year old member of the Politburo, who also died of illness within 15 months. In turn he was replaced as General Secretary by the 74-year old Konstantin Chernenko who died from illness eleven months later. The image of the Soviet leadership was transformed. With an aging and fragile leadership at the helm, the Soviet Union was also experiencing a signiﬁcant slowdown from its earlier dynamic rates of economic growth. This situation was compounded by needless cultural restrictions, reinforcing the sense among young people of "stagnation" in the government.</p>
        <p>When Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of the party in 1985 he represented the ascension of a new generation of leadership - now three generations removed from the actual 1917 revolution. He was trained as a lawyer. Tellingly, he was a favorite of the most right-wing anti-communist leaders in the camp of imperialism: Margaret Thatcher, the anti-union Conservative leader in Britain, and Ronald Reagan in the United States.</p>    
        <p>Thatcher beamingly announced "we can do business with him" (emphasis added) when</p>
        <p>Gorbachev had visited Britain in 1984, the year before he was named general secretary. These were welcome words to those in the summits of authority in the Soviet Union. There was a strong sense among these leaders that the People's Republic of China was gaining economically and technologically from its reintegration into the world capitalist economy while the Soviet Union's economy was experiencing stagnation. The United States had imposed an absolute blockade of technology on the USSR at the very moment when the high-tech revolution in computers and electronics was on the verge of reshaping and modernizing the means of production on a scale as grand as the industrial revolution.</p>
        <p>The Reagan administration had also launched a full court press — an economic and political oﬀensive reinforced by huge new military spending meant to further drag the Soviet Union into an arms race it could not aﬀord or win.</p>
        <p>Once in power Gorbachev announced a new doctrine labeled "universal human rights" to replace the Marxist theory of class struggle. Rich or poor, capitalist or wage worker, everyone would now be regarded as a human being each with a set of universal rights. Imperialist governments recognized that in this new formula the Soviet leadership was renouncing not only the class struggle in an abstract way but was diluting or softening any anti-imperialist position in its foreign policy. It was understood as a concession to capitalism — not a strengthening of socialism — and it only made their appetite for counterrevolution more voracious.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union was in obvious need of political and economic reforms. But the ones introduced by Gorbachev, "Glasnost," Russian for political openness and "Perestroika," Russian for economic restructuring, set into motion a full scale and catastrophic unraveling of the economy while simultaneously allowing imperialist-backed open anti-communists to take control of the mass media in the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>That unraveling dealt a major psychological blow to socialists and communists everywhere — even those who were severe critics of the Soviet leadership. A new slogan — or rather a slogan that had not been seen since 1917 — rippled through the press, academia, popular culture and classrooms across the globe: there is no alternative to capitalism. The vision--of an egalitarian organization of society and its abundant resources--was cast aside as a utopian dream. The ideological challenge to socialism was greater at the end of the 20th century than at the beginning of the century; instead of "socialism will never work" and the "workers cannot hold power," the new arguments went: "socialism was tried and failed."</p>

        <h2>THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION & THE REVIVAL OF SOCIALISM TODAY</h2>
        <p>The Party for Socialism and Liberation was formed in 2004, thirteen years after the demise of the USSR. The worldview and analysis of the Party for Socialism and Liberation grows out of a fundamental agreement with the conclusion that the overthrow of the Soviet Union was the greatest defeat ever suﬀered by the world working class. It has been our thesis, since we began the process of building or rebuilding a new communist party in the United States, that we were doing so in the context of what we described as an era of global counterrevolution. This era has been deﬁned speciﬁcally by the overthrow and demise of the Soviet Union, which occurred through the vehicle of a largely peaceful counterrevolution.</p>
        <p>The U.S. military actions against independent nationalist governments from Iraq to Libya to Syria, the establishment of AFRICOM by the Pentagon, the huge assault on basic social programs for working people in the capitalist countries, the ideological oﬀensive that declared communism is dead -- these are just some of the features of the era of global counter-revolution. If Venezuela had a Bolivarian Revolution in 1960 it would have been able to "go all the way" because it could have affixed itself to a world socialist system and resisted the punishing economic sanctions and economic warfare, not to mention military assault, with which it must contend.</p>
        <p>When we decided to begin building the Party for Socialism and Liberation we did so with an openly expressed understanding of the unfavorable international climate created by the overthrow of the strongest and most advanced socialist state.</p>
        <p>The era of counter-revolution will not end all at once. But capitalism and imperialism cannot dispense with the contradictions of its economic order by simply thumping its chest and proclaiming "we won the Cold War." Arrogant triumphalism and the proclamation of its own immortality ("the end of history") by a terminally ill social system will not actually give it eternal life.</p>
        <p>A quarter of a century following the overthrow of the Soviet state, socialism is now rising again as a mass political current. Socialist organizations are growing. Young people in particular, less infected by Cold War propaganda, are gravitating to socialist ideas as the alternative to capitalism, a system that produces savage brutality and exploitation on a daily basis, that pushes all workers and nations into a "race to the bottom" so as to appease banks and corporations. It is ﬁtting that all this coincides with the centennial of the Russian Revolution, the event that established for all time that the working class could and would seize and hold power through the mechanism of a people's revolution and the creation of a workers' state.</p>
        <p>The ideologues of capitalism proclaimed and still insist that the demise of the Soviet Union meant the end of socialism and communism as an alternative to the system based on private property, proﬁt and exploitation.</p>
        <p>This is both ahistorical and wishful thinking. The ultimate collapse of the ﬁrst socialist experiment will not save capitalism. The system's crises and contradictions, its foundational feature requiring human exploitation and the class division of the human family into oppressed and oppressor classes, means that the class struggle and thus the struggle for equality and socialism will continue to rage. From this perspective it is the conviction of the Party for Socialism and Liberation that the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union will not be remembered in history as the end of communism but rather its ﬁrst real-life initiation, marking a heroic, pioneering eﬀort — the lessons from which will be emblazoned on the banners and in the consciousness of all socialists and communists of future generations.</p>
