      <hr>
<p>The formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922 brought together more than 120 distinct peoples, each with their own language and culture, who had been oppressed under the former Russian Czarist empire. This great achievement grew out of the Russian Revolution of 1917. It would not have been possible without a profound struggle to overcome national oppression and a correct position on what was then referred to as "the national question."</p>
<p>It was Karl Marx who ﬁrst expressed the position of the communist movement on the national question. The Communist Manifesto was written in 1848. Bourgeois-democratic revolutions had exploded throughout Europe against autocratic, reactionary monarchies and empires like the Austro-Hungarian, Prussian and Russian empires. These revolutions were led by the rising bourgeoisie against feudalism.</p>
<p>Marx and his co-thinker, Frederick Engels, stood for ﬁghting all forms of oppression. Their goal was to organize the workers to overthrow capitalism worldwide and establish socialism. Marx and Engels saw the national bourgeois-democratic struggles as progressive, because they were the inevitable and necessary step in the revolutionary development of capitalism over feudalism. Uniﬁcation into nation-states laid the basis for the development of capitalism and the further development of the working class.</p>
      <section id="a1s1">
        <h2>MARX AND IRELAND</h2>
<p>Marx's analysis of the Irish question was one of his most important contributions on the issue of self-determination for oppressed nations. Marx at ﬁrst did not think the Irish nation could achieve independence alone, or that it should. He thought the Irish nation and workers would be liberated when English workers overthrew the English bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>The way he saw it, the English workers lived in an advanced capitalist country and were in a more advantageous position to overthrow capitalism in the colonizing country of Britain. That was how he envisioned the emancipation of the Irish at ﬁrst.</p>
<p>But by the late 1860s, Marx recognized the virulent racism and chauvinism among the English workers themselves against Irish people. He came to support self-determination and independence for the Irish nation as the best means for the Irish workers to ﬁght capitalism. He urged the English workers to stand up for Irish independence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Marx argued that an English workers party, representing workers from an oppressor nation, had the duty to support an oppressed nation's self-determination and independence. This attitude became a very key part of Lenin's view on the national question as it relates to oppressed nations.</p>
<p>This view recognized that even when the English workers did not beneﬁt materially from their bourgeoisie's oppression of Ireland, they still had become infected with their ruling class's chauvinism and racism. So it was the English workers party's duty to ﬁght colonialism.</p>
<p>English workers could never attain liberation as long as the Irish continued to be oppressed. It is similar to his view about the United States, when Marx said during the time of slavery, "Labor in white skin will never be free as long as labor in black skin is branded."</p>
<p>Lenin was later to write: "The policy of Marx and Engels on the Irish question serves as a splendid example of the attitude the proletariat of the oppressor nations should adopt towards national movements, an example which has lost none of its immense practical importance." ("The Right of Nations to Self-determination," 1914)</p>
<p>Lenin, continuing the Marxist approach, had to struggle over and over with other socialists who were opposed in principle to the right of national self-determination.</p>
<p>This was mainly because some of these Social-Democratic parties were petty-bourgeois and greatly inﬂuenced by the fact that they lived in empires like the Austro-Hungarian or Russian empire at that time. They didn't see independence as viable for other smaller nations. Lenin more than once referred to these socialists as "Great Nation chauvinists," that is, that they identiﬁed with the dominant nation's oppression over other nations.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s2">
        <h2>THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE: 'PRISON HOUSE OF NATIONS'</h2>
<p>Lenin's profound understanding of the national question was aided by the fact that he was from Russia, the most multinational state of the time. Czarist Russia was not a nation; it was a state composed of 200 nationalities and languages. It was known as Russia because of the dominance of the "Great Russian" nation. The term "Great Russian" was used to distinguish the dominant nationality from the White Russians or from the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>These three Slavic nations were in fact very closely related. A person from the Great Russian nationality could understand the language of a White Russian or a Ukrainian. Great Russians made up about 45 percent of the population. The three main Slavic nations were 110 million out of the 140 million at the turn of the century. All the other nationalities made up about 30 million, compared to 60 million Great Russians.</p>
<p>The ethnic diversity of the empire and later the Soviet Union was truly amazing. But the experience of the minority nationalities before the revolution was common: institutionalized oppression. Their languages were often banned. Some peoples had no written language. Most people in the oppressed nations could not read or write.</p>
<p>Czarist Russia was known as the "prison house of nations" because of the very brutal and autocratic rule by the Czarist nobility over the many subject peoples. Russian workers and peasants were also oppressed as workers and peasants. But the other nationalities—Georgians, Azerbaijanis or Turkic peoples and the others—suffered extra oppression.</p>
<p>The state religion was Orthodox Christianity. Jews were denied all rights. Muslims were considered religious enemies.</p>
<p>Even when the czar was forced to concede a Parliament—the Duma—after the 1905 Revolution, Muslims were not allowed to vote.</p>
<p>Corliss Lamont, in his book "The Peoples of the Soviet Union," quoted a Muslim cotton grower describing the relations before the 1917 Revolution in what later became Turkmenistan. "The past was a stairway of years carpeted with pain. The Uzbeks feared to go along the street of the Arabs; the Tajiks carried sticks when they walked through the Uzbek quarter." Yet they were all Muslim.</p>
<p>Jews also suffered tremendous oppression. Under the czar, there were over 100 laws that denied Jews basic rights. They could not own land or work in agriculture, they could not be in government, work in the post office or on the railroads. They were victims of pogroms—large-scale massacres unleashed by the czar.</p>
<p>The biggest problem that many of the nations faced was extreme underdevelopment and feudal conditions. Among some of the Central Asian nationalities, women were treated as property who could be killed if they dared to read or write.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s3">
        <h2>IS WORKING CLASS UNITY POSSIBLE?</h2>
<p>For Lenin, as leader of the Bolsheviks, the question was how to develop a party and lead a revolution in such a multinational state, with all the divisions among the nationalities and peoples, with all the oppression experienced at the hands of the Great Russian nation, with all the mistrust and understandable resentment toward the Great Russians of all classes. How could the Bolsheviks build the unity of all workers and oppressed peoples that was necessary in order to overthrow the czar and build socialism?</p>
<p>The formal view of many Marxists of that time was, "All workers are workers, all poor peasants are poor peasants, we should all unite!"</p>
<p>But the real situation required more than such formal and mechanical declarations. Simply saying "unite," meant ignoring the national oppression and virulent racism faced by the oppressed nations.</p>
<p>The Great Russian nation denied language rights and culture and imposed greater taxes against others. This chauvinism by the nobility infected the Russian workers and peasants. In turn, all the oppressed peoples were deeply resentful of this racism and repression.</p>
<p>How, Lenin asked, could there be real unity under these circumstances between the workers of the oppressor nationality and the workers of the other nationalities?</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s4">
        <h2>THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION</h2>
<p>For Lenin, the key was for the Great Russian working class and the revolutionary party to make clear their unequivocal opposition to every manifestation of Great Russian oppression, privilege and racism. The party had to be the leader in ﬁghting for equality of language rights, equality of education and of cultural rights. He was conﬁdent that the unity would come about when the oppressed peoples, especially the workers and peasants, were conﬁdent that the Bolsheviks were committed to self-determination and equality.</p>
<p>Lenin said that the party must show that it ﬁghts to eliminate all the deeply embedded biases and privileges connected with being Great Russians. In notes dictated in December 1922, he noted that:</p>
<p>"[W]e nationals of a big nation, have nearly always been guilty, in historic practice, of an inﬁnite number of cases of violence; furthermore, we commit violence and insult an inﬁnite number of times without noticing it."</p>
<p>"That is why internationalism on the part of oppressors or 'great' nations, as they are called (though they are great only in their violence, only great as bullies), must consist not only in the observance of the formal equality of nations but even in an inequality of the oppressor nation, the great nation, that must make up for the inequality which it obtains in actual practice." ("The Question of Nationalities or 'Autonomisation,'" Collected Works v.36, Progress Publishers, 1971, p.607)</p>
<p>To make it completely clear that the revolutionary workers' party was committed to ending national oppression, it must also support the right of the oppressed nation to separate to form its own state. That did not mean that socialists advocate for a separate state in every instance; in some cases, socialists might argue the inadvisability of an independent state or the beneﬁts of union. But they must be uncompromising in their rejection of bourgeois "unity" as a cover for continued national oppression and subjugation by "great" nations.</p>
<p>Unity, if there was to be unity, must be on a completely voluntary basis, stated Lenin. Its most important prerequisite is the commitment of party members from the oppressor nationality to ﬁght energetically against national oppression and racism.</p>
<p>At the same time, he called for party members from the oppressed nationalities to ﬁght for working class internationalism. He warned against any concessions to bourgeois nationalism, which "joins the proletarians and bourgeoisie of one nation and keeps the proletarians of different nations apart." ("Draft program for the fourth congress of social-democrats of the Latvian area," May 1913)</p>
<p>"Workers who place political unity with 'their own' bourgeoisie above complete unity with the proletariat of all nations are acting against their own interests, against the interests of socialism and against the interests of democracy." ("Theses on the national question," June 1913)</p>

        <h2>WORLD WAR I AND THE STRUGGLE AGAINST IMPERIALISM</h2>
<p>With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, clarity on the socialist perspective toward oppressed nationalities became more important than ever.</p>
<p>All of the major imperialist empires and powers joined in the war. All evoked national chauvinism to motivate their respective working classes to ﬁght other workers so that the imperialists could re-divide the world. Lenin showed that the imperialists were not ﬁghting to defend self-determination but to annex other countries, and that it was more important than ever to defend smaller countries' right to independence.</p>
<p>Even as Lenin insisted on self-determination for all nations, he also saw that with the ﬁrst imperialist world war, the contradictions of capitalism had brought the socialist revolution closer. He had to grapple with a further developing reality in the world: that some areas were far more advanced in the capitalist phase than others.</p>
<p>By 1914, the continents of Africa, Asia and Latin America had been carved up and divided among the imperialist powers. Lenin wrote his monumental works on the implications of this period and the relationship between the struggle inside the imperialist countries and the anti-colonial struggles.</p>
<p>In April 1916, Lenin wrote "The Socialist Revolution and the Rights of Nations to Self-determination." He said that society had reached a level of objective development where socialism was now possible and within reach. The victorious socialist countries' ﬁrst task would be to complete the extension of bourgeois democratic rights for the population, and would have to recognize the right of oppressed nations to self-determination.</p>
<p>Lenin described three types of countries:</p>
<p>"First, the advanced capitalist countries of Western Europe and the United States. The tasks of the proletariat of these ruling nations are the same as those of the proletariat in England in the nineteenth century in relation to Ireland.</p>
<p>"Secondly, Eastern Europe: Austria, the Balkans and particularly Russia. Here it was the 20th century that particularly developed the bourgeois-democratic national movements and intensiﬁed the national struggle. The most difficult and most important task in this is to unite the class struggle of the workers of the oppressor nations with that of the workers of the oppressed nations.</p>
<p>"Thirdly, the semi-colonial countries, such as China, Persia and Turkey, and all the colonies which have a combined population of 1,000 million people. Socialists must not only demand the unconditional and immediate liberation of the colonies without compensation … they must also render determined support to the more revolutionary elements in the bourgeois-democratic movements for national liberation in these countries and assist their uprising—or revolutionary war, in the event of one—against the imperialist powers that oppressed them."</p>
<p>In Lenin's 1916 pamphlet, "Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism," he wrote that the struggle of the semi-colonial and colonial countries was no longer in most cases against feudalism, but against imperialism.</p>
<p>The February 1917 revolution in Russia brought the capitalists to power under Kerensky. The ﬁrst challenges that the new Provisional government faced dealt with national oppression. How would all the oppressed nations relate to the Russian government now that the czar's centralizing terror was smashed?</p>
<p>Finland and Poland proclaimed their independence immediately. During czarist rule, the ruling classes of these nations had not pressed for independence. They were content to simply demand autonomy, because the bourgeois forces of both countries were fearful that such a move would spur on the revolutionary masses.</p>
<p>On Nov. 7, 1917, the Bolsheviks came to power, overthrowing the capitalist Kerensky government. Not a week passed before the Bolsheviks laid out a whole new series of revolutionary decrees and institutions designed to bring about equality among nations and ending centuries of oppression.</p>
<p>The next three difficult years, characterized by civil war and imperialist intervention, provided many rich lessons in how the Bolshevik policy on national oppression would be put into practice. Only after these conﬂicts subsided was the new Soviet state able to fully carry out those vital tasks.</p>

      <h1>Harry Haywood's contributions to the National Question and the ﬁght for class unity</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">July 1, 2014</div>

<p>Harry Haywood was a long time member and leader of the Communist Party-USA and other communist organizations from the 1920's until his death in 1985. He was the key ﬁgure in developing and popularizing the concept that Blacks represented a separate "nation" inside the United States.</p>
<p>While Haywood merits almost no mention in many accounts of Black history, his theoretical innovations probably did more than any other one individual to frame the terms of the debate about the historical character of the "Black community."</p>
      <section id="a2s1">
        <h2>THE "BLACK BELT THESIS"</h2>
<p>The "Black Belt thesis" established the oppression of African Americans as a "national question" of utmost importance for revolutionaries in the United States.</p>
<p>What became known as the "Black Belt" thesis has its roots in the conception of Black Americans initially conceived by Haywood and other communists of various nationalities in the Communist International.</p>
<p>Basing itself on the conceptions developed by Lenin and grounded in the Soviet experience with oppressed nations, this theory held Blacks in America made up not simply a racial or ethnic group, but comprised an oppressed nation. The thesis was adopted at the Sixth Congress of the Communist International—under Stalin's leadership—in 1928.</p>
<p>This conception did not mean nation in the sense of the "nation-state" as today's common usage would suggest, but rather had its roots in the concept of how nation states were formed by capitalism. As feudalism gave way to capitalism, the new social system smashed the barriers of innumerable ﬁefdoms, and through a long process of war and market growth took people of different historical backgrounds and across relatively large areas and molded them into one people with a common language, national market, culture, etc. Each nation-state that developed in this way— the most common examples of this process being Western European countries, such as France and England—had a unique historical development.</p>
<p>Lenin's traditional conception had held that "multi-national states" appeared in countries where the process of capitalist development had been uneven, where non-capitalist or semi-capitalist economic forms played major roles economically and socially. This held true for tsarist Russian empire, where the Romanov monarchs sought to introduce advanced capitalism, without making any changes to the country's feudal character. Russia thus created a fusion of the most advanced capitalist methods, alongside the social structure and agricultural life of the 13th century. This historical unevenness created a multinational nation-state, spanning an entire continent, involving over 100 different distinct nationalities and ethnicities.</p>
<p>Haywood saw a similarity in the situation of African Americans. Although brought to America from many different ethnicities and cultures, the unique experience of slavery overtime forged Africans into a new distinct people. For Haywood, this was not only a cultural phenomenon—in which Blacks developed a common identity based on their common experiences and struggles—but also had a geographic basis. The transformation of Africans of disparate backgrounds into a common African American nation occurred over a deﬁned land base in the Deep South where Blacks maintained a majority of the populace.</p>
<p>After the overthrow of Reconstruction, debt peonage in the south and the Jim Crow system further ingrained the super-exploitation of Blacks in the "Black Belt" south as a dominant and enduring feature of U.S. capitalism. The region in question, Haywood argued, in fact represented an internal colony. What followed from this was the notion that if Blacks made up a "nation" within the United States, they also had the right to self-determination—that is the right to form their own nation-state in the Black Belt South.</p>
<p>A full discussion of the Black Belt thesis and its modern relevance is far beyond the scope of this article. But in this author's opinion, Haywood's concepts still represent the best starting point to understand the Black "national question." One can debate the south-centered "land base" of a potential Black nation, but one cannot debate the unique historical evolution of African Americans as a distinct nation within a multi-national state.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that, unlike almost all other theories propagated on this issue since Harry Haywood ﬁrst addressed it, Haywood's concepts were based on a detailed and systematic class analysis of the actual conditions of Blacks in America. His skillful use of the historical materialist method sets a high standard for all Marxists to follow.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a2s2">
        <h2>DISTINCTIONS FROM BLACK NATIONALISM</h2>
<p>During this period, the CPUSA's anti-racist militancy stood apart from nearly all other organizations with white members in U.S. society.</p>
<p>Harry Haywood did not develop his theoretical conceptions on the Black nation out of any desire for Black separatism; he was totally committed to the idea of a united working class party. However he realized only a party that bases itself on a life and death struggle against white supremacy could overcome the obstacles to class unity. Such a struggle was necessary to earn the trust of the Black masses on one hand, and to break white workers away from ruling class ideology on the other.</p>
<p>While Black communists collaborated with all sorts of other forces in the mass struggle, Haywood made a clear distinction about the program of communists. The communists' efforts to win working-class leadership of the Black liberation struggle and their advocacy for socialism as the only resolution to national oppression, brought them into conﬂict with bourgeois Black leaders of both the "integrationist" and "nationalist" type.</p>
<p>Haywood subjected both the bourgeois integrationist trend and the nationalist trend in the 1930s Black community to a class analysis. The integrationist NAACP and Urban League, represented by "successful businessmen, top-echelon leaders, upper-bracket educators, and local politicians," typically commanded leadership of the Black movement, due to their deep linkages to Wall Street and white philanthropic organizations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the nationalists were rooted in the Black "ghettos" among "small businessmen, the intelligentsia, professionals and the like" and expressed the desires of the Black petit-bourgeoisie, stunted by modern imperialism, to control the economic life of Black urban communities. In conditions of crisis especially, Haywood noted, the nationalists' appeal to race solidarity or Back-to-Africa programs had the capability of attracting large sections of the Black poor, for whom the integrationists provided no economic answers.</p>
<p>Haywood asserted it was necessary for communists to recognize the anti-imperialist, revolutionary potential and historical legitimacy of the Black nationalist movement. At the same time, Haywood warned the Party that the militancy of its petty bourgeois stratum "is very misleading" (424) and repeatedly pushed the Party to not make the opposite mistake of "surrendering to the propaganda of local nationalists."</p>
<p>Haywood's point is further reinforced by the fact that "Black capitalist" schemes have on several occasions found support amongst the most reactionary elements of the white community, from the Ku Klux Klan to Richard Nixon, who proclaimed in 1968 that many Black militants merely wanted a "piece of the action" rather than an overturning of the social system.</p>
<p>One good example of Haywood's departure from petty bourgeois Black nationalism is in the "Don't Buy Where You Can't Work" campaigns of the 1930's, which took root in Harlem, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. These campaigns, led by local Black nationalists who shunned work with whites, took aim at the white-owned stores that excluded Blacks from employment while selling products in the ghetto. Nationalist leaders called for the white employees to be replaced with Black employees at the targeted stores, a demand that quickly developed a signiﬁcant following.</p>
<p>Haywood knew that the campaigns thrived on the "justly felt anger" of the Black working-class, but argued that "the ruling class was overjoyed with this type of movement" because it blurred the class line and "tended to quickly become anti-white." They "directed the struggle against these small establishments, which had only a small fraction of jobs," as well as white workers, and thus "the broad struggle of Black unemployed was diverted away from the large corporations located mostly outside the ghetto."</p>
<p>Haywood argued that the Communist Party could not stand aloof from this struggle for Black jobs, instead calling for the Party to focus on a broader campaign, spearheaded by Black and white unionists, which did not call for the ﬁring of any existing workers.</p>
<p>Many then and since have criticized the CPUSA for this, considering it an unnecessary concession to white workers that weakened the struggle. Ira Kemp and Arthur Reid, two nationalist leaders, were some of the leading critics of the CPUSA. They had started something known as the Harlem Labor Union, which won some jobs for the community by convincing store owners to hire Black workers at lower than the prevailing wage.</p>
<p>In contrast, Haywood's tactics always started with the Party's strategic outlook: building Black-white unity in the ﬁght against both national and class oppression. Indeed, Haywood devoted a good deal of his political energies, as well as his later autobiography, to this fundamental question facing revolutionaries in the United States.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a2s3">
        <h2>'BLACK AND WHITE, UNITE AND FIGHT!'</h2>
<p>Building class unity has never been an easy task. For one, white supremacy has long functioned as an unofficial state religion. Secondly, Black people in the United States face "special oppression" above and beyond the "normal" forms of oppression meted out by capitalist society; the resistance to these forms of oppression will thus take a unique form.</p>
<p>Finally, looking over the country's history, a pattern emerges in which Black people surge forward in struggle, become the engine for radicalism in society as a whole, but are crushed by the combined forces of the ruling class before a sizable enough section of white workers recognize their common interests with the Black freedom movement.</p>
<p>Liberals and nationalists tend to accept this pattern as inevitable and irreversible, but draw opposite conclusions: either that Black people should go slow and not demand so much (the liberal argument), or that Black people should focus on carving out spaces or states independent of the existing social order (the nationalist argument). Revolutionary Marxists support the right of self-determination, but also propose a different solution to the uneven development of political consciousness among different sectors: a ﬁghting organization that has fused together the workers leading in each sector, maintains signiﬁcant inﬂuence in each, and frames tactics that promote the common beneﬁts of class struggle and Black liberation.</p>
<p>This perspective of promoting multinational unity is easy to uphold on paper, but must be fought for in practice. Stirring up racism among white workers has long been the most powerful weapon in the ruling class's arsenal. Further, Haywood recognized that the nationalist sentiments of the Black working class inevitably would ﬁnd some expression within the Party—a phenomenon that he warned against most emphatically in the Party's 1934 Convention.</p>
<p>Haywood wrote:</p>
<p>"Just as the ruling class ideology of white supremacy had its inﬂuences on white comrades, it was not unusual that Black comrades would similarly be affected by petty bourgeois nationalist ideology. These moods were and sentiments were expressed in feelings of distrust of white comrades, in skepticism about the possibility of winning white workers to active support in the struggle for Black rights, and in the attitude that nothing could be accomplished until white chauvinism was completely eliminated. This latter was particularly dangerous because it failed to understand that white chauvinism could only be broken down in the process of struggle."</p>
<p>The two trends of white chauvinism and petty bourgeois nationalism were not equivalent, but both "deviated from the line of proletarian internationalism" and needed to be tackled. As a leading Black member of the CPUSA, Haywood played his part in upholding the long-held division of labor in the communist movement with regards to national oppression: comrades of the oppressor nation would lead the ﬁght against chauvinism inside the Party's ranks, while comrades of the oppressed nation must combat narrow nationalist deviations.</p>
<p>Haywood stressed that any slacking on the part of the Party in leading the practical struggle among Black workers would disarm their ability to combat both considerable dangers.</p>
<p>Haywood recognized that multi-national unity is not a feel-good exercise, or simply a helpful secondary factor. Rather, a united working class is the only road to an overthrow of capitalism, which holds the only chance for the full liberation of the mass of Black workers, who constitute the vast majority of Blacks in America.</p>
<p>This is the legacy left to us by Harry Haywood: a critical and uncompromising dedication to the total liberation of Black workers, the working class, and humanity itself.</p>

      <h1>National Representative Assemblies from Socialist Reconstruction</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">August 25, 2022</div>
      <div class="author">Party for Socialism and Liberation</div>
      <hr>
<p><i>The following text is from the PSL publication Socialist Reconction, chapter The Socialist Government: The Form and Function of a New Democracy</i></p>
<p>Socialist government has to ensure that decisions impacting the entire country are taken and overseen by bodies with representation from the entire country. To this end, we envision a central socialist government that, like the current US government, also has two chambers. For legislation to become law it will need to pass both chambers. Unlike the current government, the socialist one will be designed to be truly representative.</p>
<p>The ﬁrst chamber will be the National People's Assembly. Conforming loosely to the current House of Representatives, the National People's Assembly will consist of delegates elected from local election districts and from mass organizations representing various sectors in society—labor unions, women's organization, youth, etc. It will need to be numerically much larger than the current 435-member House of Representatives in order to guarantee adequate representation from all urban regions, smaller towns, and rural areas. Currently, there is about one representative in Congress for every 750,000 citizens in the country. This an absurdly small number for a democracy. For instance, in Cuba there is one member of parliament for every twenty thousand citizens. In addition to expanding the number of representatives, socialist reconstruction will establish guidelines guaranteeing the working-class character of the National People's Assembly and requiring women make up at least half of the elected delegates. The redrawn administrative units discussed in the preceding section will ensure that the National People's Assembly is representative of the multinational working class. No longer will the 83 percent of the country who live in urban areas be dominated by the interests of those living in low-populated, primarily white districts. None of the delegates will be full-time politicians.</p>
<p>The second chamber will be the Assembly of Oppressed Nations. The Assembly of Oppressed Nations will replace the US Senate—the US version of Britain's House of Lords. For the last 440 years, the US capitalist class has secured its wealth and domination over society by the theft of the lands of the Indigenous peoples and nations of North America and by the enslavement and subsequent super-oppression and exploitation of African Americans. Institutions of racism were constructed to enforce this system and ensure the ongoing disenfranchisement and marginalization of tens of millions of people. To correct this historic injustice and to guarantee the full unity of the working class on the basis of genuine equality, the Assembly of Oppressed Nations will function as a second chamber. It will consist of delegates from oppressed nationalities and peoples. To become law, proposed legislation will need to secure a majority vote in both the National People's Assembly and the Assembly of Oppressed Nations.</p>
<p>Regional and local affairs will by managed by either a Regional People's Assembly, for larger urbanized regions, or a Local People's Assembly for smaller cities, towns, and rural areas. Unlike the undemocratic and ineffective federal system, in the centralized socialist system laws will be universally applied throughout the country.</p>
