      <h1>Fifth Party Congress,<br>Preparing for the 5th Party Congress of the PSL</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">October 2020</div>
      <div class="author">Brian Becker</div>
      <hr>
      <p><i>The following is an excerpt from a document submitted to the Central Committee by Brian Becker and approved by the Central Committee at its October 2020 meeting.</i></p>
      <p>In early August 2019 the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) held its 4th Party Congress and ratiﬁed a strategic framework document titled The Role of Socialist Consciousness in a Revolutionary Process in the United States to act as a guide or orientation for the period ahead.</p>
      <p>The premise of the document is the PSL's unshakeable belief in the "actuality of revolution" here in the center of world capitalism.</p>
      <p>The strategic framework predicts that mass upheavals are looming that are rooted in multiple foundational crises caused by the very nature of late-stage capitalism and its decadent, corrupt and criminal ruling class. Three particular foundational crises were cited as the likely triggers for creating a revolutionary situation inside the United States.</p>
      <p>The strategic framework document states in its ﬁrst section: "One thing that's certain is that the number of people who are facing impoverishment will increase. The tools of state repression will be employed with increasing fervor against nationally oppressed communities. And the intensity of struggle and resistance from those who are the most oppressed in society will continue to act as a motor force for radical change."
      </p>
      <section id="a1s1">
        <h2>FOUNDATIONAL CRISES OF CAPITALISM SET THE STAGE</h2>
        <p>Today, just fourteen months (as of this writing) after the 4th Congress, the United States is plunged into a descending economic crisis evidenced by mass unemployment, mass evictions and hunger; a nationwide uprising against racist state repression; and an out-of-control disease outbreak. The loss of 50 million jobs is not the result of COVID-19. It is literally a policy choice of the U.S. capitalist class and its stooge politicians from both parties that control Congress. The European and Asian capitalist governments took another path. The failure to protect U.S. society from COVID-19 is also a failure of the capitalist ruling class. And the nationwide revolt against racism is in response to the decision by the capitalist class to grant impunity and immunity to the hundreds of thousands of armed agents of the state who occupy and terrorize Black and Latino communities.</p>
        <p>The core of the PSL's strategic orientation adopted at the 4th Party Congress has already been validated: that "mass upheavals are looming" as a consequence of "multiple foundational crises" that are emblematic of the "very nature of late-stage capitalism" in the United States and elsewhere. COVID-19 and the killing of George Floyd were triggering events in the past six months. But it is late-stage capitalism in general and the malignant character of the U.S. ruling class in particular that are at the root of the widespread dislocation and crises that are tearing at U.S. society and calling out for revolutionary transformation.</p>
        <p>More than 226,000 people (as of this writing) in the United States have died from COVID-19. That's one out of every ﬁve fatalities in the world. The disastrous impact of the failed U.S. response to COVID-19 is a failure of the ruling class and both of its political parties. Working class families with school age children at home have been forced to go to work while having no childcare because children were not in school. Millions of teachers, warehouse workers, nurses, EMTs, public transportation workers, grocery store workers, workers in the meat-packing industry and others were compelled to go to disease ravaged workplaces while every member of the ruling class had multiple, frequent and prompt tests and access to the best health care services. More than 8 million workers lost their health care coverage in the middle of a pandemic because they were laid oﬀ. More than a million health care workers were ﬁred or laid oﬀ in the middle of the biggest U.S. health care crisis in the last century.</p>
        <p>The multiple unsolved social, economic and environmental crises caused by the U.S. ruling class are not going away. This is not a momentary blip where the old "normal" returns and the ruling class rights a sinking ship. Even if there was a return to some level of social stability it will be short lived.</p>
        <p>The destruction of millions of jobs is not a temporary phenomenon but rather a harbinger of what is coming. The capitalists' access to artiﬁcial intelligence and other technologies will plunge tens of millions of highly or semi-skilled workers into perpetual impoverishment. This is the same workforce that is educated and skilled such that it could easily organize and maintain production and the delivery of goods and services without any capitalist bosses. Displacing and replacing workers on a mass scale will accelerate. So will homelessness and hunger.</p>
        <p>The wildﬁres in California and other parts of the West are the consequence of cascading, overlapping and simultaneous crises. In Louisiana, six named storms devastated communities in just the last few months. The utter failure of the U.S. government and the ruling class it serves are obvious -- they are the real culprits. Even now, when apocalyptic images of climate catastrophe are being viewed not in a movie dramatizing a distant, dystopian future but rather in mid-morning outside people's windows in the center of San Francisco, the capitalist government does not bother itself with the emergency mobilization and reorganization of the economy to end the use of fossil fuels.</p>

      <section id="a1s2">
        <h2>NEW ERA OF INTENSIFIED CLASS STRUGGLE</h2>
        <p>Diﬀerent capitalist sectors now believe that the current system is breaking apart and they are focused on looting the national treasury and relief packages. They don't care about what is "best for their system" but rather are focused on grabbing hold of as much as they can loot. That is not unexpected.
          Super-monopolies are taking advantage of the moment to crush smaller businesses. While the current pandemic has exposed the dysfunctionality of the system, other and even bigger crises are on the way. And almost overnight a consensus position has been adopted, without debate, in Congress and the Pentagon that the United States should now prioritize war with China (and Russia) as the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy and Pentagon war-ﬁghting doctrine.</p>
          <p>The U.S. capitalist ruling class is not about to abolish the police. That is utopian thinking -- at best. Just the opposite is coming. Trump's latest deployments of armed federal agents in Portland is being repeated in many jurisdictions. Yet the deployed federal forces are numerically small compared to the existing local police departments who play the same repressive role and use the same tactics. The ruling class relies on police power domestically and military power globally to enforce its control. Trump's deployment of federal agents to kidnap protesters in Portland and elsewhere is an indicator of the direction of the ruling class. It is important to remember that it was the Obama administration that used federal anti-terrorism authorities and structures to coordinate the nationwide crackdown on the Occupy movement in 2011. That movement was snuﬀed out by a federally-led, coordinated crackdown and 7,000 people were arrested in a two month period. Internal documents from the FBI and Fusion Centers at that time showed that the government assessed that Occupy was a "peaceful" movement and yet it moved forcefully to crush it. Anarchist leadership and tactics made Occupy particularly easy prey for the capitalist state.</p>
          <p>Our current strategic orientation is grounded in the observable intensiﬁcation of class polarization accompanied by capitalist destabilization which are the prerequisites for a new era of intensiﬁed class and political struggle against capitalism. The premise is that class polarization and class struggle is the order of the day. We use the term "class struggle" in its all sided meaning. The class struggle is not only the struggle between capital and labor at the point of production or at the workplace. As Marxists we view the many and varied struggles against oppression in the capitalist society as expressions of the class struggle. The nationwide revolt against racism is a manifestation of the class struggle since the deployment of racist policing against the Black working class and the ruling class' war against Black America is a fundamental feature of class rule in this country. The class struggle will intensify in the coming period. Of course it will ebb and ﬂow but we are projecting political trajectories not simply for a few months but for an entire period. COVID-19, government failures in responding to the pandemic and the attendant mass unemployment and impoverishment of tens of millions of workers, coupled with a nationwide revolt against racism, have set the stage. Permanent job loss from new technologies, environmental catastrophe and coming imperialist war will accelerate this process. This was the core thesis of the 4th Party Congress and provides an overarching strategic framework that guides our agitation, slogans, tactics and organizational priorities. A socialist, working class party that seeks revolutionary change must have a strategic framework that provides a coherent analysis of the current situation and provides tactics and slogans that point the way forward. Yes -- reality is multi-sided, complex, dialectical and dynamically contradictory, but a party cannot lead without focusing on that which is the essential core of the political situation and being bold enough to announce the path forward. Endless activism without a strategic orientation leads nowhere. A ﬁghting program that corresponds to reality is essential to the success of the socialist movement.

        <h2>THE REVIVAL OF SOCIALISM IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>
        <p>The 4th Party Congress Strategic Framework document and the decisions of the 4th Congress were premised on the conclusion that after decades of political stagnation the socialist movement will take shape as a major force in the center of world capitalism and that the seemingly unresolvable crises of modern society would demand the replacement of capitalist ruling class power with a new class power. The "spectre" of socialism has already become a dominant theme in the 2020 election. Trump accuses the Democrats and Biden of being the agents or catalysts for "radical socialists" and Biden's retort is basically "no we're not." Socialism is a major issue now in American political discourse but not yet a major force. Conventional wisdom in the United States posits that socialism will never be a major political force. Others on the left take a slightly less pessimistic view but premise their tactical assumptions on the idea that socialists should not get their hopes up about the prospects for socialism in the foreseeable future. We disagree. The PSL was formed in 2004 and it has conducted its work with focus and urgency based on the prospect of the revival of socialism and the actuality of revolution. The analysis is rooted in an assessment of the objective conditions of late-stage capitalism and its multiple "unsolvable" crises.</p>
        <p>Socialism requires the conquest of political power by the working class. That is the ﬁrst step toward socialism. It doesn't guarantee the victory of socialism but it is an indispensable prerequisite for socialism</p>
        <p>By what means can this conquest of power in the United States take place? This is the most important question raised in the thesis adopted at the 4th Party Congress. How can it happen here? What is the prerequisite condition(s) for dislodging the capitalists in the United States from power and creating a state based on a new class power.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s4">
        <h2>CONDITIONS FOR REVOLUTION</h2>
        <p>Prerequisite conditions for revolution have two parts -- objective conditions that create instability and paralysis of the government of the capitalists in the face of seemingly unresolvable societal problems and the subjective state of that force in society which has both the strategic capability to take state power and implement a program that solves society's most pressing problems that seem "unresolvable" under the old order.</p>
        <p>Affirming that the objective conditions for revolution and socialism are maturing and will undo the existing stability of capitalist rule over society, the PSL is asserting that the paramount need of the moment is to build the Party and to train leaders and cadres and assist a new generation of devoted revolutionaries in acquiring the necessary theoretical, political and organizational skills to eﬀectively lead the new socialist movement in the United States. But the success of this eﬀort and of the victory of the socialist movement can only happen if there is a vanguard sector that is conscious of how victory can be achieved in the center of world capitalism. This perspective distinguishes revolutionary Marxism from all other tendencies and shades of "radical" or "progressive" politics.

      <section id="a1s5">
        <h2>THE PROCESS IN THE U.S.</h2>
        <p>The road to a successful revolutionary process here will be distinctly diﬀerent from all earlier socialist revolutions. And locating and identifying the fundamental distinctiveness of the U.S. road to revolution informs us of the key task or most urgent need to succeed in the transformation of class power and governance.</p>
        <p>What is the critical diﬀerence between a socialist revolutionary process in the United States and earlier socialist revolutions? In the earlier socialist revolutions the communist parties and revolutionaries took power through their role as leaders of the armed struggle against foreign colonizers and their stooges or in the case of Russia as a result of an urban insurrection against the continued Russian presence in the ﬁrst world war coupled with peasant land seizures after the abdication of the czarist monarchy.</p>
        <p>To succeed, to take the power, a socialist revolution in the United States will by necessity require a majority or very large minority of the working class to embrace or sympathize with the socialist program. This is what we mean by socialist consciousness.</p>
        <p>Building socialist consciousness on a mass scale means merging socialism with every movement for survival -- every struggle for housing, food, income, health care and education. By mass socialist consciousness we mean building an understanding or awareness among the people -- especially those who are suﬀering the most -- that it is the capitalist ruling class and its government that are the source of their misery; the cause of hunger, homelessness, racism and all the obvious injustices in the "richest country" in the world. It's not the Republican Party or the Democrats. It is not this or that evil capitalist billionaire or evil corporation or bank or vicious individual cop that is causing the suﬀering of the people or destroying the environment. The anger, outrage and mobilization of the masses of people has to lead to a growing awareness (consciousness) that each of the core problems leads directly back to the capitalist ruling class and its government. A new economy that exists exclusively to meet the needs of the people and to protect the environment and planet must be a socialist government and a socialist economy.</p>
        <p>Without this socialist consciousness every mass struggle of the people leads eventually to the movement functioning as a lobby that pleads or demands that the government do the "right thing." Demanding speciﬁc reforms now is necessary. But even in this the revolutionaries must build awareness that the extent to which concessions are granted is 100 percent dictated by exactly how afraid the ruling class is of not granting the concession in the face of the outraged and mobilized people.</p>

        <h2>HOW CONSCIOUSNESS GROWS - A CENTRAL LESSON FROM THE NATIONWIDE REVOLT AGAINST RACISM</h2>
        <p>What is the number one, central lesson of the recent nationwide revolt against racism that began in Minneapolis and spread like wildﬁre in the following weeks? It is that the intervention of millions of people in mass actions can suddenly alter the political climate and consciousness of the nation almost overnight. New organizations form where there were none. People ﬂock in droves to join organizations including the most revolutionary ones. The capitalist government suddenly starts making concessions or promising concessions that seemed unthinkable just weeks earlier.</p>
        <p>The nationwide revolt against racism has already gone through multiple stages, it has ebbed and ﬂowed and that will continue. But it must be understood by us as a dress rehearsal for what is coming. It has involved a rising of tens of millions of people. It spread into the smallest towns. It has been vast and multinational in composition and anchored in the resistance of Black working class young people. It demonstrated the possibility of class unity in a movement. It is precisely this type of class unity that is key to the victory of socialism just as it was the key to the defeat of slavery. There is no other path to save society from the death grip exercised over its vast resources by the class of billionaires.</p>
        <p>It is no accident that capitalists and their philanthropies have rushed in recent weeks to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to fund non-Marxist currents in the movement. If the mass movement cannot be crushed and if it is likely to endure, one section of capitalism realizes it must be defanged, tamed and integrated into the capitalist establishment as a "lobby." A similar phenomenon happened in the late 1960s. The government violently suppressed the Black Panther Party, Kwame Ture, Jamil Abdullah
        Al-Amin, Assata Shakur and countless other revolutionaries on one hand while providing massive funding to co-opt others. Today the funds are ﬂowing, particularly to those who oppose revolution or who argue against the need for or the possibility of multinational revolutionary class unity anchored in the resistance of the Black working class. These same forces cannot actually explain the reality that this nationwide revolt against racism demonstrated in life -- not as a hypothetical thesis -- that such class unity is not only possible but takes form as an organic, foundational feature of the rising movement of the people. While anti-capitalist rhetoric abounds from time to time the goal of this wing of the
        "non-proﬁt" world is not revolution.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the semi-Marxist ivory tower "lecture-from-the-sidelines" intellectuals on the left or reactionaries on the right say that revolution and socialism is impossible here. The "conventional wisdom" about the impossibility of revolutionary politics in the United States is as superﬁcial as it is false.</p>

      <p><i>The following is an excerpt from a document was submitted by Brian B. on March 8, 2019 to the Central Committee for discussion, and approved on March 31, 2019 by the Executive Committee for distribution to the membership.
      </i></p>
      <section id="a2s1">
        <h2>THE ACTUALITY OF REVOLUTION IN THE UNITED STATES</h2>
        <p>"Who ever made a great revolution knowing beforehand how to carry it through to the end?" asked Lenin. "Where could you get such knowledge? It is not to be found in books. There are no such books. Our decisions could only be born out of the experience of the masses."</p>
        <p>By what road will the socialist revolution arrive in the United States? What are the required preconditions for its success? And what sector(s) of society will function as the anchor of the revolutionary process?</p>
        <p>Based on the experiences of other modern revolutionary processes we must assume that a socialist transformation of society will be rooted in a signiﬁcant, cohesive social stratum of the working population, from which the necessary militancy and energy - not to mention the actual human beings who produce and convey this militancy and energy – will propel the revolutionary process forward as it confronts innumerable contradictions and obstacles along the way.</p>
        <p>It is necessary for revolutionaries and a revolutionary party to answer these paramount questions. Given the changing composition of the working class and of work itself in the latest stage of capitalism, this requires a thorough investigation that must include a survey and assessment throughout the country, and can't be answered in short-hand here. One thing that's certain is that the number of people who are facing impoverishment will increase. The tools of state repression will be employed with increasing fervor against nationally oppressed communities. And the intensity of struggle and resistance from those who are the most oppressed in society will continue to act as a motor force for radical change.</p>
        <p>These questions and issues speak directly to the actuality of revolution inside the United States. They are not on the agenda of any leadership body from the Democratic Socialists of America or frankly any of the other organizations inside the United States that call themselves Marxists, socialists or communists. The reason for this is not simply a lack of ardor and courage; or an expression of timidity. The problem lies elsewhere. Most don't believe in the actuality of revolution inside the United States. They can, perhaps, imagine revolutions elsewhere and be inspired by them, engage in solidarity actions with them and/or content themselves to assume the position of wise observer or critic regarding the decisions of socialists or communists elsewhere. But they do not believe it is possible here — because they believe the imperialists are just too strong to be defeated or the vast majority of people here are just too backward to ﬁght for revolutionary change.</p>
        <p>We formed the PSL with the belief in and affirmation of the actuality of revolution here.</p>
        <p>The main reason to build a disciplined, democratic-centralist, cadre-based organization that is united around a political program is speciﬁcally to prepare for revolutionary crises that open the door to the realization of revolutionary transformation. In a non-revolutionary period, such an organization is vital to cohere otherwise dispersed leaders and movements; to synthesize, learn from and implement the lessons of the varied forms of class struggle, which never stops; to preserve and communicate revolutionary ideas and organizational methods; and to train ever-larger number of organizers in the sort of discipline needed to combat and overcome the centralized bourgeois state. But that is the whole point: to actually win.</p>
        <p>In June 2019 the PSL will have existed for ﬁfteen years. The organization has demonstrated its viability as a political formation. It has learned hard lessons rooted in real experiences. It has developed cadres. Its membership and inﬂuence have grown. Geographically we have expanded considerably. We have built the organization on a step-by-step basis. We have consistently adopted new and larger tasks but without insisting that the Party take on and solve problems for which there were no available remedies. The organizational norms we've developed derive from our practice, have been tested in life, and have served us well and allowed us to not only survive but start to thrive in the present political period with all its contradictions and challenges. In this sense, the critical aspects of the foundation for a revolutionary party, the prerequisites for it, have been established.</p>
        <p>We have insisted for years that the conditions and prospects for reviving and popularizing socialist ideas in the United States were coming. This was not a passive prediction but rather a central part of the PSL's Strategic Framework adopted in 2013 — which we dubbed "RPI" for Recruitment, Popularization of socialism, and International coordination — and that has guided our tactics since. It was also the basis of our orientation toward the 2016 election campaign and the Bernie Sanders campaign in particular, which reﬂected the new openness to socialism and — regardless of Sanders' own motivation — also fostered new levels of interest in socialism (of all varieties).</p>
        <p>It is noteworthy that Donald Trump proclaimed to thunderous applause at his State of the Union speech that "America will never be a socialist country." No other president in recent time has felt compelled to publicly reject socialism as the road to be taken by the U.S.</p>
        <p>As support for socialism has increased among its rank and ﬁle voters in recent years the central leaders of the Democratic Party, along with the central pillars of the pro-Democratic Party capitalist media, have repeatedly gone on record to oppose socialism, disclaim it and present it is as unrealistic, unwise and un-American.</p>
        <p>That anti-communist counter-attack hasn't really worked. Socialism is clearly on the political agenda — meaning it is in the political discourse around politics and the 2020 election campaign.</p>
        <p>The most important need right now is for the PSL to intervene forcefully and persuasively in this political discourse. There needs to be powerful and compelling deﬁnition given to socialism. For socialism to win in the United States, it must be openly adopted and embraced as the political framework (or ideology to use an imprecise term) of tens of millions of working class people, and especially young people, inside of the United States.</p>
        <p>The PSL needs to widely promote a clear, winning explanation of what the socialist program means for the transformation of the economy, government, criminal justice, education, health care and for the way society utilizes energy resources.</p>
        <p>The revolution in the United States, by a much greater degree than earlier socialist victories elsewhere, will require an explicit embrace of socialist ideas in and among the working class and among intermediate classes who are being ground down by monopoly capitalism. It is important for our Party and movement to recognize precisely why the program of socialism itself must be embraced by the majority, or at least a very signiﬁcant minority, of the working class for a successful socialist transformation inside the United States.</p>
        <p>The 1917 revolution in Russia was initiated as a revolt against monarchy, autocracy and unending war that had shattered millions of lives and the whole way of life of huge sections of the population. The main program in Russia was for land (for the peasant majority), bread (to overcome mass hunger) and peace (as a way to exit Russia from World War l). The revolutions in China, Vietnam, Korea, Yugoslavia and Cuba were in their essence national liberation movements against colonialism and semi-colonialism.</p>
        <p>In the colonial, and semi-colonial world too the socialist orientation of the revolution was due almost exclusively to the fact that communist parties played the leading role in the indigenous armed movement for national liberation. The communists won their rightful place as the head of the emerging nation by virtue of their leadership of an armed struggle against foreign occupiers, colonizers and their puppet comprador dictators. After victory, the task at hand was to develop the means of production to overcome extreme scarcity, poverty, underdevelopment, illiteracy, and the remnants of feudalism. After victory each of the successive governments declared the objective of building socialism, enshrined considerable social and economic rights in the new constitutions, and then used a variety of socialist and capitalist methods to overcome extreme underdevelopment.</p>
        <p>In spite of several valiant eﬀorts, as of yet there has been no successful revolution (whereby the working class seized and held state power) in the countries that constitute the core of world capitalism. The revolutionary process in the United States will be fundamentally diﬀerent than those that unfolded in other countries in the last century. Those revolutions were on the periphery of world capitalism not at its core. As Lenin stated, Russia was the "weakest link" in the capitalist chain and thus it broke more easily. Using the same metaphor China, Vietnam, Korea, Yugoslavia were even weaker links in the chain of various capitalist empires that shattered all at once between 1940-1945 under the staggering violence of World War ll.</p>
        <p>World capitalism united under the tutelage and leadership of U.S. imperialism following the Second World War. That global united front worked to push back and smash the "menace" of socialism in a multi-pronged non-stop assault against these countries and governments. This global class war against socialism made it a requisite of the U.S. ruling class to smash pro-socialist organizations and ideas on the homefront and among the working class. The center of revolutionary gravity therefore moved far away from the core centers of world capitalism. The struggle for the bourgeois democratic revolution merged with the socialist aspirations of communists who led this dual struggle. The political focus and thus the consciousness of the mass movements centered on independence, national liberation and development. Within that framework, communists made the compelling case that the only way to truly smash the old colonial and neocolonial regime was to uproot its economic system and replace it with one that prioritized, for the ﬁrst time, meeting the needs of the formerly colonized country.</p>
        <p>By contrast, it is impossible to have a socialist revolution inside the United States without socialist ideas being adopted by the majority or a very signiﬁcant minority of the working class. There are several reasons for this. The U.S. working-class movement will not come to power via a defensive ﬁght against a foreign occupier. There is no cross-class alliance to be formed based on American national independence or national development to overcome scarcity. Nor does the U.S. capitalist class already operate with a monarchic or openly dictatorial political form; it operates its class dictatorship within a bourgeois-democratic shell. While there are of course crucial battles for political and civil liberties, there is no basis for a "bourgeois-democratic revolution" that would grow into a socialist process.</p>
        <p>The battle for genuine democracy requires at this stage a comprehensive reformulation of social and economic rights, which can only be achieved by socializing the private monopolies and giant corporations that dominate the productive process and so much of economic life. It would require ﬁnally resolving the fundamental contradiction between socialized production and private property, by "expropriating the expropriators." This is the core concept and essential content of the socialist program.</p>
        <p>The capitalist ruling class and its ideological institutions will make sure to frame any social movement aimed at the radical restructuring of priorities (for instance around climate change, economic democracy or guaranteeing human needs as social rights) as socialist and communist.</p>
        <p>No matter how one can see a revolutionary crisis developing, the socialist program will not simply sneak into it at the end of the process. Politics today, even in this non-revolutionary period, are closely followed and hotly debated on a day-to-day basis by tens of millions of people; the news, and interpretations of the news, are pinging instantly into hundreds of millions of cellphones at every moment in the form of images, videos and the written word. Socialism is already being widely discussed, even now when the struggle is not at a mass scale and the socialist movement is only beginning to register gains. In a period characterized by more intense class struggles, the pace, intensity and depth of this discourse will be exponentially greater.</p>
        <p>Revolutions become possible with the merger of a required set of objective and subjective conditions. A revolutionary socialist strategic framework can only succeed with a correct understanding of both the subjective and objective requirements for success. Socialists, in general, have limited control over the maturation and pace of the needed objective conditions. Lenin's leadership of the Bolshevik party was a decisive factor in the victory of the Russian Revolution. Without World War I, however, there would have been no revolution in Russia during Lenin's life. Only a few people would would even know of him or read any of his works. Wars, economic implosions, environmental catastrophes, unsolvable crises within the ruling class are beyond the control of socialist parties. These are the objective conditions that give rise to revolutionary opportunities. What socialists can inﬂuence and, in fact, be decisive in is the maturation of the subjective conditions that make revolutions possible.</p>
        <p>The foundation of our strategic framework as we prepare for the 4th Party Congress is that communists and socialists in the United States must fervently prepare, train, educate and organize for the launching of a mass movement in this country that is predicated on the socialist program.</p>
        <p>This thesis builds upon some long-standing theories of revolution that have prevailed in the Marxist left but applies and updates it to the distinctive needs of the revolutionary process in the United States in the 21st century. Some revolutionaries have hoped merely that as the contradictions of capitalism intensify and grow into a crippling political crisis of legitimacy for the ruling class, a socialist party — based on the trust it has won through practical organizing in the class struggle — can then step into the breach, and provide a program to resolve the crisis, and lead the working class to power via insurrection. The workers will at that point recognize the organization that has had a correct and consistent line throughout, and then come over to it. Some, or maybe all, of the elements of this formula may still hold true in an eventual revolutionary process. But it is a formula that can be interpreted in such a way that downgrades the urgency of winning workers and oppressed people to the socialist program through all the phases of class struggle. It led to a culture of self-censorship among socialists, especially considering the Cold War environment and particularly beginning in the difficult period of retreat in the late 1970s. The important mass work around the battles of the day cannot substitute for the promotion of a socialist program and construction of a mass revolutionary socialist party.</p>
        <p>This is especially so given the distorting ideological impact that the non-proﬁt sector has on social movements — which itself is a deliberate and well-reﬁned strategy from sectors of the liberal ruling class. It is not true that the "bread-and-butter" struggle — the working class struggle for survival — will by itself grow into a socialist movement, let alone a socialist revolution, or that this task can be postponed until later. A socialist party cannot content itself with being the best organized, committed and devoted to those grassroots struggles; the loyalty and respect won through such organizing must be translated into political and ideological leadership or that good work will be co-opted and ultimately overshadowed by this or that slick-talking bourgeois representative. This is a modern form of the "economist" revisionism of Marxism that Lenin polemicized against in What Is To Be Done?</p>
        <p>Under the new conditions inside the United States, where the popularization of socialism can reach unprecedented levels, this means the PSL must focus like a laser in expanding its organizational capacity to eﬀectively promote the socialist program and socialist solutions in all types of struggles and all types of areas.</p>
        <p>We have to speak and present as the leaders of the country. The socialist program must be the focus of the establishment of the movement for emancipation. The Manifesto that was adopted by the People's Congress of Resistance at its inaugural event was an important step forward. This modest initiative demonstrated in embryo the basis for the building of a new, united front socialist movement with a communist party at its organizational core.</p>

      <h1>Second National Party Convention,<br>Recruiting New Cadres and New Leaders</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">2006</div>
      <div class="author">Party for Socialism and Liberation</div>
      <hr>
      <p><i>The following is an excerpt from a document from the Second National Party Convention.</i></p>
      <p>A revolutionary program without cadre cannot go very far. Each human being we recruit, either into the milieu of the Party or into its ranks, lives in the existing class-based society. Capitalist values and concepts, individualism, alienation and all "the crap" from bourgeois society impact on every person without exception.</p>
      <p>Assisting people to become genuine cadres and revolutionaries is a fundamental responsibility of all members of the Party. Even more so, it is the Party's obligation, and a requisite and fundamental need, to help train new leaders from the working class and the youth. Thousands of leaders are needed to carry out the multi-sided tasks of the new socialist movement.</p>
      <p>What do we mean by leadership? Rather than giving an abstract answer to the question, our particular deﬁnition should be rooted in the fulﬁllment of our basic task and the pursuit of the core revolutionary strategy. The Party does not substitute itself for the people but rather, in the core strategy that Lenin outlined, the function of the communists is "to facilitate the political awareness and political organization" of the working class. The role of the Party as a leader of the class is to "facilitate" the awareness and organization of the oppressed class. The same can be said of the role of the leadership inside the Party. Leaders are those who help facilitate the development of others. This is the exact opposite of the fundamental bourgeois concept of leadership. The leaders in class society are the "special few." Class society is a pyramid. At the very top, at the pinnacle, are the "leaders." They are served by others. In the communist architecture we turn the pyramid upside down.</p>
      <p>As each of us develops skills, through a combination of arduous work and by receiving mentoring from others, a communist provides leadership by facilitating the awareness, training and organization of others. The embrace of responsibility and the willingness to exhibit and promote the ideas of socialism and devotion to and faith in the development of the working class are the foundation of "leadership." Authentic communist leadership draws ever larger numbers of people into participation and work, and it assists others to become leaders. This deﬁnition of leadership rips down the individualistic mystique that is the norm in bourgeois society with its worship and infatuation of the rich, the powerful and the celebrity.</p>
      <p>A good example of the basic qualities and function of communist leadership can be found in the job of an editor. We can use our own magazine as an example. We have three or four levels of editors. There is the Executive Editor, the Managing Editors, Copy Editors and the Technical Editor(s). The editors select a story list, they select writers and provide each of them with direction for their articles. When the stories come in they work many, many long hours editing, re-writing, editing again and then sending the articles to be copy-edited and then to be laid out in the most attractive way possible. It is a collective process from beginning to end. Sometimes, you might hear a writer refer to "my article or my story," which in one sense may be accurate, but really it is not true because there would be no article and certainly nothing of the quality that the public enjoys without the editor, managing editor, copy editor and technical staﬀ.</p>
      <p>This combined editorial collective, with its leadership demarcated through a division of labor, is the actual leadership. It is the leadership that has facilitated the work of others and facilitated the enhanced political awareness of those who read and study the magazine. Whether a magazine is communist or pro-capitalist, the goal of the editorship is to assist and facilitate the work of others. In our case, we view all of leadership in this way: Does it facilitate the awareness and organization of others? It is self-sacriﬁcing and the opposite of individualistic.</p>
      <p>In all cases people are selected or chosen for particular roles based on their individual availability, ability and desire, but we must educate all members and new recruits that the real test of leadership lies in the ability to facilitate the political awareness and organization of others, just as the Party's function is to facilitate the political development and organization of the working class as a general matter. That job, that quintessential leadership, is a function of all cadres. Without this understanding the Party cannot evolve into the revolutionary vanguard. It will be on the basis of this leadership model that we will recruit the best forces in society. And it will be through practice, and practice alone, that the masses of people will learn that the cadres of the PSL constitute a unique leadership in bourgeois society.

      <h1>Third Party Congress,<br>On Cadre Development</h1>

      <div class="author">Party for Socialism and Liberation</div>
      <hr>
      <p><i>The following is an excerpt from a Third Party Congress Document on “Communist organization, party building in the coming period, the role of mass organizations in the popular struggle and the need to create a united front against fascism”.</i></p>
      <section id="a4s1">
        <h2>A VEHICLE FOR TRAINING</h2>
        <p>The PSL exists as a real-life bridge of the previously existing communist movement and the current generation or the new generation of activists. We retain communist theory and can apply it correctly to the evolving struggle. We have a considerable core of young revolutionary cadres who have been won over to Marxism.</p>
        <p>During the next period of our development, we need to continue emphasizing and perhaps emphasize more the centrality of Marxist theory. If Marxist theory is more or less relegated to the pages of books that were written more than a century ago, they will not take root spontaneously in this or future generations of activists. There must be a bridge.</p>
        <p>We have made a major contribution by the republication and updating of Marx and Lenin's writing on the state, and Lenin's writings on imperialism. Numerous people around the country have taken notice of this and it has drawn some to our milieu. Other central works of Marxism need to be published and studied and re-studied, but they also must be updated in order to have a wider contemporary audience. As we do this, we can not only recruit into our milieu older communists, but have a profound theoretical inﬂuence on younger activists if we can draw them into study with us.</p>
        <p>To do this, we need to emphasize theoretical development, not just for PSL members but for everyone in the movement who is serious, and we need to create platforms for political discussions, dialogue and study with non-PSL members, and especially among non-PSL organizers in broader mass movements.</p>
        <p>During the next period, we have to emphasize the training of our cadres in Marxism and Marxist theory, and create vehicles for theoretical and political study that draws in other activists. Unless this is prioritized, we will simply focus on activism and practical intervention, which by itself will be completely inadequate to overcome the problem of the two-generation skip that has created such an obstacle for the spontaneous revival of socialism from existing mass movements.</p>
        <p>This work will not take oﬀ if only a small circle of comrades involve themselves in it. More and more comrades need to take it on, step by step, as a key aspect of what it means to be a communist in the current era: that is, to be able to explain and apply key Marxist concepts (including the necessity of building a Party) to one's co-workers, neighbors, classmates and fellow activists in a popular and persuasive way. Agitating, recruiting, learning and teaching — bringing the science of the class struggle into the daily reality of the class struggle — this is what it means to be a communist.

      <h1>Second Party Congress,<br>RPI: The Three pillars for our organizational plan</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">2013</div>
      <div class="author">Party for Socialism and Liberation</div>
      <hr>
      <p><i>The following is an excerpt from a 2013 Second Party Congress Document.</i></p>
      <p>What measures can we take that will be most eﬀective in contributing to the task of transitioning from counter-revolution to revival?</p>
      <p>We are proposing an organizational plan that features three pillars in accordance with our strategic framework:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 15px">1) <b>Recruitment</b>: The Party itself must grow numerically. There is no better demonstration of the revival of socialism or the viability of socialism than to create a recognized, living organization that promotes Marxism and socialism, and that has a signiﬁcant number of members and an obvious visibility through its websites, newspaper, radio broadcast, online university, publications (including books and magazines), and through social media.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 15px">2) <b>Popularization</b>: It is a requirement that we engage in a popular and persuasive presentation of Marxist theory and socialist ideology. The ability to revive the popularity of socialist ideas is far greater today as a consequence of the new communication technologies, the internet, social media, etc. In order for socialism to become the main doctrine for those opposed to capitalism, and the diﬀerent manifestations of oppression, we must popularize the basic theoretical and political precepts of Marxism. Marxist theory and socialist ideology provided a comprehensive answer to the basic problems associated with the capitalist social order, as well as providing a guide to action in the struggle against capitalism. Marxist theory and socialist ideology was a magnet for all those in struggle because the basic concepts were popularized through thousands of Marxist socialist newspapers and other socialist media in every country. Following the collapse of the world communist movement, bourgeois ideology promoted the basic idea that Marxism and socialism had been defeated; that the Marxist doctrine was proven in life to be false, and that it no longer had relevance in the modern world. This bourgeois oﬀensive against socialist ideology has had a profound impact on consciousness.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 15px">3) <b>International coordination</b>: As the Central Committee pre-Congress document asserts, the fate of every socialist and revolutionary movement, no matter the country in which it is located, is inextricably connected to the global movement for revolution and socialism. This has been true since the mid-19th century. Marx and Engels, as well as the other revolutionary leaders of that period, established the First International in an attempt to give organizational expression to the universal struggle of the working classes against the then-existing social order. The First International was a multi tendency organization and was relatively short lived. But nonetheless, it marked the internationalization of the working-class struggle. Of course, most of the participants in the First International were from Europe and the United States.</p>
      <p>We cannot successfully make the transition from the global counter-revolutionary trend to the revival of socialism except in the international or global context. The strong revolutionary movements in Latin America, the expanding communist movement in parts of Europe and in Asia, and the eﬀorts by revolutionaries in the Middle East have a direct dialectical impact on each other and on the global movement.</p>
      <p>Again, to carry out our task of reviving socialism, we want to strengthen our connections with other communist and revolutionary forces around the world who, like the PSL, are fully aware of the negative international climate and are seeking greater international cooperation to revive the global movement. This desire was particularly evident in the anti-globalization movement and the anti-war movement of 2003-2004, as well as during the "Arab Spring" and the Occupy Movement. The revival of socialism can happen by creating international cooperation, a united front of sorts, with revolutionaries elsewhere, whereby we use our websites, Liberation Radio, newspaper, online university and social media to not only promote the materials of the PSL but use them as a platform for other revolutionaries.</p>
      <p>This concept of establishing three pillars of the Party's work to accomplish the task outlined in the strategic framework can be known as RPI for short - Recruitment, Popularization and International coordination.</p>
      <p>The PSL organizationally and every PSL member can operate within the framework of these three organizational priorities. The purpose of the Congress and the task of its new Central Committee would be to facilitate the organization of the party so that every Party unit, every mass organization and every individual comrade can be most eﬀective in "R" - recruitment and in "P" - the popularization of socialist ideas. It would be the task of the Central Committee and the Party's propaganda/agitation institutions and mass organizations to draw ever-closer connections with revolutionary and socialist forces throughout the world.

      <h1>Third Party Congress,<br>Further on the "Era of Global Counter Revolution"</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">2016</div>
      <div class="author">Party for Socialism and Liberation</div>
      <hr>
      <p><i>The following is an excerpt from a 2016 Third Party Congress Document.</i></p>
      <section id="a6s1">
        <h2>FROM REVOLUTION TO COUNTER-REVOLUTION</h2>
        <p>Since the end of World War II, with the exception of Greece between 1945 and 1948, there have been no attempted socialist revolutions in the Western imperialist countries. There have been many mass movements, but no revolutionary assault against the existing state power.</p>
        <p>While the revolutionary movement was muﬄed in the West, the center of revolutionary energy shifted to Asia. The Chinese Revolution, along with the revolutions in Vietnam and Korea, the anticolonial movements in India, Indonesia, the Philippines and elsewhere rocked the old social order in Asia. Likewise, anti-colonial national liberation movements became dominant in the Middle East and in Africa. Only in small Cuba was there a successful socialist revolution in the Western Hemisphere; both Nicaragua and Grenada were embryonic socialist revolutions at the time of the seizure of power in 1979.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, and most importantly for our current discussion, the counter-revolutionary destruction of the Soviet workers' state and the capitalist takeover of the governments in Eastern and Central Europe between 1988 and 1991 inaugurated a period that we have correctly labeled the era of
        counter-revolution.</p>
        <p>We are making, in this assessment, a distinction between the period of non-revolution that existed in the western countries following World War II (1945-1985) and the era of "global counter-revolution," which changed the relationship of forces and the political landscape for every country in the world.</p>
        <p>It is worth taking a moment to understand this distinction. The ebb of revolutionary energy in the West, as evidenced shortly following the close of World War II, coincided with a rise of revolutionary energy in the East and in the South. This was not only evident in the geographic location of the class struggle and the struggle for national liberation against imperialism. It also manifested the change in the location of revolutionary socialism and communism. Leninism and communism waned in the West, but were strong in China, Vietnam, Korea and elsewhere in Asia. In Africa too, communism was revived in Ethiopia, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissou and in South Africa. Cuba, which was closer to African and to Asia, was the source of revolutionary energy and communist leadership.</p>
        <p>The era of counter-revolution is not located in Europe or in the West. It has been a global phenomenon. Its impact has been everywhere. Not only was the global communist movement essentially broken and to a large extent disintegrated, but imperialism was able to go on the oﬀensive to smash the anti-colonial governments and movements. One need only look at the Middle East today. Imperialism has destroyed Iraq, Libya and a good part of Syria. Also destroyed have been the secular, communist, socialist and bourgeois nationalist political forces that dominated the anticolonial project in the Middle East. In the place of these vanquished political forces has arisen the most right wing and reactionary political forces, such as the so-called Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, and other right-wing Jihadi political organizations and militias. Wherever they have gotten the upper hand in the space created for political reaction, these forces have waged ruthless war against leftists, progressives, secular nationalists, women and religious minorities.</p>
        <p>The destruction and overthrow of the Soviet government was by far the greatest setback and defeat for the socialist and working-class movement in all of history</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a6s2">
        <h2>PRINCIPLE ORGANIZATIONAL TASKS IN A NON-REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD</h2>
        <p>We have formed the foundation of a revolutionary party. That is a prerequisite for future growth. We have established a political program and engaged in nationwide training of revolutionary cadres. We are attempting to promote Marxist theory and recognize that without revolutionary theory there can be no revolution. For the purposes of winning reforms or providing defense against ruling-class attacks on the rights and living standards of the people, it is necessary to have organization. Agitation and propaganda by themselves are completely insufficient not only for the actual revolution; they are insufficient for any kind of struggle that takes place in a non-revolutionary period.</p>
        <p>Recruiting cadres and training cadres in communist agitation and propaganda, and in organization, is a complex and long term process. Learning how to enter into reformist political arenas, into the political or electoral arena, participating in the labor movement, joining spontaneous mass movements, building bridges and alliances into the working class and amongst and within oppressed communities -- these are the principle tasks of the moment. They are all complicated and require attention and constant work.</p>
        <p>Lenin, in his writings in 1902, argued that the organization must be professional and not amateurish. The struggle for professionalism or to build an organization of professional revolutionaries was identiﬁed as the number one task when the Bolsheviks were forming as a political organization.</p>
        <p>The PSL, too, must strive to overcome amateurism. It needs to be an organization that has professional competence. It needs leaders who have not only the ability and the desire to assume leadership -- they must be available. We encourage all of our members to make the Party a top priority in their lives and the commitment of the PSL membership is of such a high caliber that we are able to accomplish a huge amount of work given our numbers and resources. We far surpass the productivity of even well-resourced non-revolutionary organizations. But to really grow, to increase our numbers, to expand our reach, to inﬂuence a greater part of the population that is coming into political life, we must have a dedicated staﬀ of revolutionaries who are supported by the organization ﬁnancially and in other ways so that they can be fully available to provide leadership in the areas of agitation, propaganda, recruitment and organization.</p>
        <p>The organizational tasks of this period include expanding the efficiency of the tactics and methods associated with the RPI framework, aggressively pursuing a recruitment and party-building strategy, engaging in a campaign to both understand and promote revolutionary theory, and to build a united front against fascism. These tasks will be addressed with other proposals and documents that will be presented at the Party Congress and then to the Party as a whole.</p>
