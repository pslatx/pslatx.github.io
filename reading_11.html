      <h1>Introduction to China's Revolution and the Quest for a Socialist Future</h1>

      <hr>
<p>In the winter of 2008 the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) published the book China: Revolution and Counterrevolution. That book outlined a distinctive position and orientation within the US Marxist Left toward the People's Republic of China (PRC). The book was published thirty years after China publicly initiated a radical reorientation of its economic system and foreign policy, frequently referred to as the Opening Up.</p>
<p>China is huge, complex, and dynamic. The 2008 book, however, had a very speciﬁc and limited objective. Its audience was relatively limited, too. It was essentially a polemic against those in the Marxist movement—including those identifying as Maoists—who decided, 1) capitalism was largely restored in China, 2) the Chinese bourgeoisie was essentially controlling the state and, 3) the Communist Party of China (CPC) itself had been captured by the bourgeoisie and its continued use of Marxist jargon was nothing more than a cover for a counterrevolution that seized power from the working class and poor peasants following Mao Zedong's death.</p>
<p>It wasn't just the Maoist Left that described China as a capitalist country during this period. Social democracy and social democratic-oriented Marxists in academia also denounced China as a new variant of capitalism, and they condemned the CPC as oppressors of the working class. Importantly, many from these currents denounced Mao and China before the 1978 economic reforms and before the Opening Up to foreign capitalist corporations. Simply put, social democrats, or many of their leading lights, were hostile to the Chinese Revolution both before Mao's death and after his successors changed the economic model.</p>
<p>The idea that China abandoned the socialist road and embraced capitalism was also widely promoted by US political establishment think tanks, academics, the US media, and capitalist politicians. Conventional wisdom asserted it was only a matter of time until the ﬁnal denouement of Chinese communism. In the Soviet Union, socialism was toppled in 1991 through the dismemberment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the overthrow of the communist-led governments in Eastern Europe, and the CPC was also dissolving socialism and embracing capitalism. The only caveat, according to this popular and dominant narrative, was that the CPC was retaining state power while the communist parties in the USSR-led socialist camp lost their power. Either way socialism was gone or disappearing. Capitalism was on the rise once again. History was ending—capitalism was indeed the crowning achievement of the species. Or so the story went.</p>
<p>The PSL took a different stance. After a two-year-long study and discussion, we published an internal document in 2007, "For the Defense of China Against Counterrevolution, Imperialist Intervention, and Dismemberment." This was a detailed review of the progress made since the 1949 revolution and the contradictions facing contemporary China.</p>
<p>This new PSL book, China's Revolution and the Quest for a Socialist Future, has a different thrust. Its core position is the same as the 2008 publication, but its function is to provide a historical survey of the Chinese Revolution. Its audience is wider. It retains an inherent polemical edge because the core political premise is reaﬃrmed. In that sense, it's both a survey and a speciﬁc interpretation of various stages of the revolution and the important debates that took place within the CPC leadership both before and after the 1949 victory.</p>
<p>Since the writing of the 2008 book the political landscape has undergone a profound change, conﬁrming the validity of the PSL's 2008 thesis. The new book has the same framework but provides a crucial update that considers the earth-shaking political changes between 2011 and 2022. But it isn't just an update. It's written for a wider audience. It provides an accessible survey of the history of the Chinese Revolution from a Marxist perspective.</p>

        <h2>CHINA TURNS LEFT . . . AGAIN!</h2>
<p>In 2011 the Obama administration announced the so-called Pivot to Asia, and in 2013 Xi Jinping became the general secretary of the CPC. The Asia pivot was not widely understood at ﬁrst. But it inaugurated a decade of growing belligerence and hostility by US imperialism toward China. By 2018 the Pentagon announced a new military doctrine making confrontation and preparation for war with China the center of US military strategy. The earlier period of cooperation gave way to what is now called a New Cold War.</p>
<p>During this same decade the CPC moved politically to the left. The Xi leadership reaﬃrmed the socialist and communist goals of the party while it carried out an anti-corruption campaign. This constituted a purge of party and government oﬃcials, many of whom maintained the rhetoric of socialism while abandoning its key tenets. The Xi leadership also acted forcefully to rein in the growing economic and political power of the capitalist class that emerged inside China since the country's sweeping economic reforms were introduced, following Mao's death in the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>China's ability to shift to the left internally is an important indicator that the sociological or class character of the PRC is the same as it was in 1949 when the Communist Party came to power after a twenty-seven-year-long civil war. Is it a pure class dictatorship of the working class and poor peasants? No. Was it ever? No. But, is China sociologically different from the capitalist countries? Indeed it is, and the Chinese revolutionary project lives on. Its continued existence is crucially important to the peoples of China and the global struggle against imperialism. This was the cornerstone of PSL's 2008 thesis. But it was presented before the leftward shifts under Xi's leadership and before the reorientation of US military and foreign policy following the Asia pivot provided clear proof.</p>

        <h2>WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO DEFEND CHINA?</h2>
<p>The PSL's political position on China has been distinctive since its inception. The party offered both a strong defense of the Chinese Revolution's continued march forward, and a well-rounded recognition and explanation of a primary contradiction with the economic model adopted in the late 1970s. The Opening Up reforms presented a huge boon to China's economic growth, but also created an extreme danger of regression, or capitalist restoration, and possible counterrevolution.</p>
<p>China's harshest critics on the left adopted the line that there was nothing to defend in the country. In contrast, many of China's leftist supporters became cheerleaders for nearly every policy pursued by the CPC. The PSL took a different stance from both.</p>
<p>The PSL argued that the militant defense of China should be premised on an independent and open-eyed assessment of a complex, contradictory process in the most populous country of the world as it sought to achieve, in a short historical period, the daunting task of overcoming the legacy of enforced underdevelopment. We maintained that an idealistic or uncritical approach toward China was not a strong defense. Idealism, once it crashes on the hard rock of reality, usually morphs into cynicism for the idealist. A stable, political defense of China must be rooted in a materialist appreciation of the contradictions of building socialism in a society that was not among the advanced capitalist countries, but rather had been plundered by them. The PSL explained the function of allowing capitalist market relations to ﬂourish in China was to acquire technology and carry out economic development. But we reject the concept of the capitalist market as a form of socialism. Socialism ultimately means the abolition of private property and the production of goods and services to meet individual and societal needs. The market is the process by which the production of goods and services present themselves as commodities to be bought and sold. A capitalist market is where surplus value—proﬁt—is realized or made for private owners of the means of production. A commodity market, if allowed to ﬂourish, grows spontaneously, and with it grows class divisions. The gamble made by the CPC in 1978 was that the state would be strong enough to retain decisive, supervisory control over the domestic capitalist market. Likewise, as long as the party could maintain state power, it would navigate the complex and treacherous relations with the economic centers of global capitalism to prevent the country from being reduced to a neocolonial status.</p>

        <h2>LENIN AND DENG—TWO POLITICAL LINES ON MARKET REFORMS</h2>
<p>The PSL also took note of how the CPC oﬃcially explained the Opening Up reforms. The language used was somewhat vague but has profound political signiﬁcance. The reforms represented the continuation or perhaps the conclusion of a long-standing two-line struggle inside the summits of the CPC. During the ﬁrst phase of the Cultural Revolution (1966-69) Mao labeled long-time leaders Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping as "capitalist roaders." It was unclear exactly what that term meant, but this two-line struggle came to a climax when Mao died in 1976.</p>
<p>Following his death Mao's closest collaborators were arrested. The most well-known included top leaders from the Cultural Revolution, including Jiang Qing, Mao's wife. Within two years the new leadership, under the tutelage of Deng Xiaoping, embarked on the policy of radical economic reform. Many of his followers outside China concluded that since the "capitalist roaders" had come to power, Mao's forecast and warning during the Cultural Revolution had come to pass. The capitalist roaders were in power and they were indeed establishing a private capitalist sector. Foreign capitalist corporations were given entry to set up shop, hire Chinese labor at low wages, and expatriate proﬁts derived from the exploitation of Chinese labor. Many leftists outside the country concluded China was socialist in words only, that a counterrevolution had returned capitalism to power, and the new party leaders employed the language of "socialism with Chinese characteristics" as a way of covering their tracks.</p>
<p>PSL rejected that notion. There was no counterrevolution. The new leadership was employing a particular economic model to overcome the legacy of underdevelopment and poverty and modernize the country. China was opening the door to major transnational capitalist corporations that would invest in China, and hire and exploit low-wage labor. In return the country would get access to modern technologies, capital inputs, training, and employment</p>
<p>opportunities for hundreds of millions of people. Similarly, the government would modify existing rules and laws to allow the development of a domestic capitalist market and thus allow the creation of a new class of Chinese entrepreneurs and capitalists. But communists would retain control of the state and government policy, overseeing the process with the ultimate power of steering investment to fulﬁll government economic plans. That which was privatized could be renationalized and transformed into public property. The coercive power of the communist-led state would be employed to maintain control over domestic capitalists.</p>
<p>V. I. Lenin and the Bolsheviks adopted similar capitalist reforms in 1920 to overcome staggering poverty and economic shortages following the Russian Revolution and a three-year-long civil war that devastated the country and its economy. The Bolsheviks invited western capitalist corporations to invest in socialist Russia, employ Russian labor, and expatriate proﬁts back to their investors. Lenin described the New Economic Policy (NEP) as a step backward, a retreat from socialism, but necessary to kick start an economy where people were dying of hunger.</p>
<p>In contrast, the CPC described the post-Mao economic reforms not as a necessary retreat from socialism, but as "socialism with Chinese characteristics." A mixed economy, part socialist and part capitalist, under the party's direction, was not an emergency measure such as Lenin's NEP but rather a preferred long-time economic model.</p>
<p>In the decades following the Opening Up reforms of 1978, the Chinese economy grew at dizzying levels. Urbanization of a country that had been predominantly rural and peasant before 1978 was carried out at a tempo unmatched in human history. While the economic achievements were unmistakable and recognized universally, characteristic features of capitalism also grew. Income inequality between rich and poor, workers and capitalists, soared. Private ownership of companies allowed a tiny part of the population who did not really work to become rich from the proﬁts derived from the labor of millions of people working long hours each week for wages.</p>

        <h2>TRANSITIONS TO SOCIALIST SOCIETY: CHINA AND USSR—TWO MODELS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH</h2>
<p>China's great economic leap under Deng Xiaoping's leadership in the 1980s and 1990s used different methods from those employed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union which had a similar dynamic period of industrialization and urbanization in the 1930s. China in the later decades, and the USSR in the 1930s, experienced growth rates far outstripping those of the major capitalist economies.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's stupendous industrial growth rates in the 1930s were motivated with the same urgency as that of the CPC leadership. It wasn't just a matter of overcoming poverty and underdevelopment. Both the USSR and China were confronted with a hostile world environment dominated by advanced capitalist governments' efforts to destroy the socialist projects in their respective countries.</p>
<p>Joseph Stalin famously stated about the USSR: "We are ﬁfty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make up this gap in ten years. Either we do it or they will crush us." He said this ten years before the Nazi invasion of the USSR in 1941.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's stupendous growth in the 1930s was based on a different model than that pursued by China since the late 1970s. The NEP ended in 1928, and the leadership embarked on a new economic model—based on almost complete state ownership of the means of production and the rapid, forced collectivization of the nonsocialist countryside.</p>
<p>The USSR's economic model of the 1930s precluded the capitalist class. It also excluded foreign capitalist corporations and banks. All the core means of production and ﬁnance were state-owned. Central economic planners dictated all elements of production and distribution in the industrial sector and much of the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>In contrast, China's Opening Up reforms included vast privatization. They allowed for the emergence of a new, indigenous capitalist class, but one whose political and economic power would be constrained by the Communist Party-led state and government.</p>

        <h2>IS CHINA A SOCIALIST COUNTRY?</h2>
<p>A question that is frequently asked is whether China is a socialist country. Although the economic model adopted by the USSR in 1928-29 was vastly different from the one adopted by China after the Opening Up, the same question was often posed in theoretical and political disputes within the Left.</p>
<p>Marxism requires the precise use of language in addressing complex political and sociological questions. In 1917 in Russia and 1949 in China, existing capitalist state power was smashed by victorious revolutions and a new state power was created. In both instances the ruling political power was assumed by Marxist-led communist parties professing socialist goals and aspirations. Did that mean they were socialist countries? From PSL's viewpoint the victorious revolutions were a qualitative step forward for both countries on the path to socialism. But the ﬁnal victory of socialism—eradicating class divisions and other manifestations of inequality rooted in the very nature of existing class society—would be the consequence of a longer historical process. The PRC deﬁnes its development as still in an early stage of this process. There is nothing in this process, in this transitional era, that offers a rock-solid guarantee of the ultimate achievement of a truly socialist society. The outcome will be determined by the struggle of class forces inside China and in the arena of global politics.</p>
<p>In capitalist countries competing ruling-class parties take turns running the affairs of the capitalist government. In the US Democrats and Republicans take turns at the helm. In recent elections in capitalist Germany the center-right Christian Democrats lost power to the center-left Social Democrats. The transfer of authority over the capitalist government between competing capitalist parties possesses no intrinsic threat to the status quo. The political superstructure in capitalist countries plays an important role, but capitalist proﬁt-making and exploitation don't require state oversight and direction.</p>
<p>In the transitional era following a socialist revolution, however, when socialism remains an aspiration and will only ﬁnally be achieved over a longer historical period, the role of the superstructure is decisive. Thus, the retention of state power by the Communist Party remains the indispensable foundation for maintaining the superstructure. In fully developed socialism—what Marxists describe as the emergence of a classless society—political parties representing differing class forces exit the historical stage. This doesn't happen where class struggles still rage, or in a world where socialism takes the form of isolated nations or clusters of nations ﬁghting to fend off counterrevolutionary threats from powerful imperialist powers.</p>
<p>The Pivot to Asia announced by President Obama in 2011 was a signal that US imperialism is determined to crush socialism in China. Since then US foreign and military policy has been dramatically reshaped to prepare for an all-out confrontation with China. This is already a dominant feature of contemporary global politics. All the more reason for Marxists living in the US to understand China comprehensively, to have a dialectical appreciation of its achievements and challenges, and to stand in defense of the Chinese Revolution which continues to shape and shake the foundations of the modern world.</p>
