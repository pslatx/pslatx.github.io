      <h1>Founding statement of the Party for Socialism and Liberation</h1>
      <hr>

      <div class="author">Party for Socialism and Liberation</div>
      <hr>
      <p>We are in a period where the world's poor and working people are waging heroic struggles against imperialist war and exploitation.</p>
      <p>Millions of people poured into the streets in the last few years to prevent Bush and Cheney's rush to war against Iraq, only to ﬁnd that this imperialist war had the backing of both political parties of U.S. imperialism, of the big business media, of the corporations and the banks.</p>
      <p>The protests were huge—the biggest anti-war demonstrations ever. The anti-war movement spanned the globe. It was an historic demonstration of unity by the people of all continents uniting against U.S. imperialism.</p>
      <p>Yet the war machine pushed ahead. Today, tens of thousands of Iraqis are dead. Thousands of GIs, workers in uniform, have been killed or wounded, with more being sent to their deaths daily. Politicians of all stripes promise “endless war” — and it is only because of the ﬁerce Iraqi resistance to the Pentagon occupation that has slowed, but not stopped, the plans for the next war for empire.</p>
      <p>If a mass movement of the magnitude of the past years cannot prevent imperialist war, what can? What will stop the next war? Or the war after that?</p>
      <p>Since 1945, every generation has been called on to send its sons and daughters to invade foreign lands: Korea, Vietnam, Dominican Republic, Cambodia, Laos, Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan. These do not include U.S.-led proxy wars against Cuba, Nicaragua, Congo, Angola, Mozambique, Colombia, the Philippines, Venezuela and others. Nor does it include the two imperialist world wars of the ﬁrst half of the 20th Century.</p>
      <p>Today it is Iraq. Tomorrow it will be others. The U.S. Senate just unanimously adopted the new military budget—$416 billion—in preparation for new invasions, new bombings, new occupations, new slaughters. The Pentagon now has a network of 750 military bases located in 130 countries—not to mention the 6,000 bases inside the U.S. and its territories.</p>
      <p>The Party for Socialism and Liberation emerges from this mass antiwar movement with the ﬁrm conviction that the source of the endless war drive is U.S. capitalism itself. The solution to
      war—to ﬁnally end the “endless wars”—is to end the system of capitalism. We need revolution.</p>

      <section id="a1s1">
        <h2>SOCIALISM IS THE ONLY ANSWER</h2>
        <p>Disguised under the label of a free market economy, U.S. capitalism has evolved into the most highly centralized form of state monopoly capitalism. The banks, the concentrated media monopolies, the transnational corporations—especially the oil and energy conglomerates—and the Pentagon have merged into a permanent warfare state.</p>
        <p>There is only one solution to the crisis posed by state monopoly capitalism: socialism. To secure lasting peace requires abolishing the dictatorship wielded by the plutocracy and its warfare state.</p>
        <p>Paciﬁst appeals to the ruling class for a “peaceful” or “kinder, gentler” foreign policy is the worst kind of deceit oﬀered up by social democrats and opportunists. Working to elect a new leader to preside over the aﬀairs of the warfare state will have zero impact in reducing the threat of war. As Lenin wrote in 1916, under the system of imperialism peace is merely a prelude to the next war.</p>
        <p>Imperialist wars like the invasion and occupation of Iraq are wars for the rich, for the banks, for the corporations. The imperialists wrap themselves in the ﬂag, whipping up chauvinism and racism against targeted countries.</p>
        <p>Our Party's message is that working people of the invaded countries are not our enemies. If, for instance, the resistance in Iraq defeats the U.S. occupation of their country, working people in the U.S. will lose nothing. When U.S. imperialism was ﬁnally defeated in its occupation of Vietnam, working people in the United States lost nothing.</p>
        <p>There are 130 million working people in the United States—including those workers without jobs, capitalism's reserve army of the unemployed. We work every day, producing all the wealth of society with our labor. Yet the reality for those that are not sent oﬀ to war grows every day more stark: lower wages, no healthcare, growing poverty, racist police violence, union busting, pervasive racism, sexism, and LGBT oppression.</p>
        <p>Our party has been created to be a vehicle for the multinational working class in the struggle for a socialist reorganization of society—a society based on the interests of the vast majority of the people, on the basis of human needs, not private proﬁt. The idea that the bosses and the capitalist state's grip on society can be abolished through any means other than a revolutionary overturn is a utopian fantasy.</p>
        <p>There are hundreds, and really thousands, of progressive organizations that carry out admirable and essential work, that ﬁght to mitigate the horrors associated with poverty, war, exploitation, racism, sexism, homophobia and other “realities” imposed by the domination of private property rights. But a revolutionary party is unique in its perspective that the transformation of the social order can take place only through the revolutionary reconstitution of society.</p>
        <p>While we will energetically participate in all the mass movements and progressive organizations, our top priority is building the revolutionary socialist party. All historical experience proves that the creation of a revolutionary party, made up of tested organizers with its base in the working class, is an indispensable factor in the socialist revolution.</p>
        <p>We adhere to the analysis of capitalism and class society initially put forward by Karl Marx and Fredrick Engels 150 years ago. Revolutionary Marxism, in contrast to all forms of moderating social-democratic interpretations of Marxism, looks to the advance of the actual class struggle as the only way for working people to dislodge the political and economic power held by the billionaire class.
        </p>

      <section id="a1s2">
        <h2>WE NEED A REVOLUTIONARY PARTY</h2>
        <p>Revolutionary Marxism requires a revolutionary party to ﬂourish and develop. Marxism is not an abstract doctrine but rather a guide to action. It must be constantly tested by action and in debate.</p>
        <p>Without a revolutionary working class party, the achievement of socialism and communism will remain a dream. Unlike the bourgeoisie, when it was a rising but still oppressed class in Europe under feudalism, the working class is not accumulating ever-increasing wealth in its hands. It was the spontaneous accumulation of wealth in the form of capital that made the eventual triumph of the capitalist class inevitable.</p>
        <p>But, as Marx showed, the process of extracting surplus value—the foundation of capitalist wealth—makes the working class continually poorer in relation to its class enemy. The rich do, in fact, get richer and the poor poorer.</p>
        <p>The small class of large private property owners sought political power for themselves as they accumulated economic power. The working class only appears as a class on the historical stage when it has achieved revolutionary class consciousness when working people realize that they should be the political power in society.</p>
        <p>The historic strength of the working class is its ever-growing numbers and its strategic position in society. Yet, these advantages remain only potential strengths, unless the working class is conscious and organized. Today the very numerous and diverse U.S. working class is still largely atomized and unorganized.</p>
        <p>A revolution cannot take place without society entering into a revolutionary crisis, a crisis which shakes the foundations of bourgeois rule, provoking a large section of the people to refuse to go on with “business as usual.” How and when such a crisis comes about is outside the control of either revolutionaries or ruling class politicians and generals. Most often in the last century it has been a by-product of war.</p>
        <p>What revolutionaries do have some control over is not when a new social crisis will come, but what type of organization will be available when a revolutionary crisis does arise, as it inevitably will. How strong, multinational, experienced, widespread, numerous and united will the revolutionary party be? How steeled will it be in many and widely varying struggles? How has it measured up to challenges, especially in earlier times of crisis?</p>
        <p>To the question, what do revolutionaries do in non-revolutionary times, Lenin's answer was to build the party, to build the organization that can transform the revolutionary opportunity into a revolutionary victory. Build now, because if you wait, it will be too late. From Lenin's point of view, the entire reason for the party from the very beginning was preparation for the revolutionary opportunity.</p>
        <p>Preparation means many things. It means being involved in the most critical struggles of the day, at the points of greatest conﬂict between the classes. It means ﬁghting to win the movements that spontaneously respond to smaller crises in capitalist society to a truly progressive and revolutionary outlook. It means reading and studying, absorbing the lessons of revolutionary struggle around the world—from the experience of Asian, African, Middle Eastern and Latin American revolutionaries, along with Marx, Engels, Lenin and the other theoretical and practical leaders of the working class and oppressed.</p>
        <p>Preparation means organizing the party for the multiplicity of challenges that it will face. It means a commitment to recruiting new cadre from among the many new, and not so new activists, and particularly among the most exploited and oppressed workers.</p>
        <p>The long and corrosive history of slavery and racism in the United States places special demands on the party of the working class. In all our preparation, we strive to build working class unity by putting the struggle against racism as a central priority in the day-to-day work of the Party and the movement, and by affirming in practice Lenin's principles of the rights of nations to self-determination and revolutionary, working-class internationalism. Only a multinational party can create the unity necessary to defeat the most powerful capitalist class the world has ever seen.</p>
        <p>Above all, it means the dedication to undertake this most important and most necessary of all tasks—building a new revolutionary workers party in the heart of world imperialism.</p>
        <p>While we are in the ﬁrst stage of creating a new revolutionary party, we have a long tradition as leaders and organizers inside the Marxist movement in the United States, as well as in the
        anti-war and anti-racist movements, in the labor movement, and in the other mass movements inside the United States. As former leaders and members of Workers World Party, we defend that group's historical tradition and mission, particularly that of its founder Sam Marcy. Although we believe that the Workers World Party leadership is no longer capable of fulﬁlling that mission, we still consider it to be a progressive organization with many honest activists.</p>
        <p>The prognosis of Karl Marx 150 years ago was that socialism would be achieved ﬁrst in the most industrially advanced capitalist societies. That is where the material basis for socialism was strongest. Rationally allocating abundant resources to meet society's needs was possible with the public ownership of the means of production.</p>
        <p>Marx's prognosis was amended by the living class struggle. The socialist revolutions took place in underdeveloped economies where human suﬀering was greatest and where social contradictions reached a boiling point ﬁrst, especially as a result of war. While the working class in these societies defeated their ruling classes ﬁrst, they were confronted by an array of obstacles in achieving socialism that resulted directly from the legacy of economic underdevelopment, colonialism and a world environment dominated by imperialist hostility, sanctions and war.</p>
        <p>The ultimate degeneration and defeat of the revolutions in the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe, apart from being a historic defeat for the workers in those countries, opened up a period of intense military expansion by U.S. imperialism, intent on monopolizing the new markets and resources on the basis of its status as the world's sole military superpower.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="a1s3">
        <h2>A NEW PHASE OF SOCIALIST REVIVAL</h2>
        <p>We are convinced that we have now entered a new phase. Capitalist economic globalization and its attendant assault on the working class at home is combining with the rapid global march of the U.S. military machine to create new social and class contradictions that will lead to a revival of the socialist and workers movement inside the United States.</p>
        <p>Most of the people in the world today are suﬀering from economic depression and recession. The U.S. ruling class is holding it breath, well aware that when the U.S. capitalist economy is seized by the next severe crisis or downturn, it is likely to precipitate a global economic crisis of historic proportions. Under those circumstances, the rule of capitalism must face the inevitable challenge of a revived movement for socialism. That is our Party's orientation. Marx's prognosis and theory of revolution in the advanced capitalist societies will be validated by the revival of revolutionary socialism in the very center of imperialism.</p>
        <p>At the same time as we aim for revolution in the United States, we stand for defense of the existing workers' states, the national liberation movements and for oppressed people around the world who stand in the crosshairs of U.S. imperialism. Only a party steeled in working-class internationalism can hope to lead a revolution in the United States, the 21st Century prisonhouse of nations.</p>
        <p>The magnitude of our tasks will be matched by our determination to win. Workers and oppressed people of the world, unite!</p>

        <h2>FIGHTING FOR REFORMS WHILE POINTING TOWARD REVOLUTION</h2>
        <p>For revolutionaries, the organizational question is critically important.</p>
        <p>Since its inception 10 years ago, the PSL leadership and membership have focused considerable thought, eﬀort and time on creating a revolutionary organization based on the organizational principles known as Democratic Centralism.</p>
        <p>For communists, the question of the type of organization we build is not a secondary issue. The structure; the style of work; the method chosen to maintain the unity of internal democracy and centralized action; the guidance provided by the Party's Constitution and Program — these were understood by the PSL in its formative stage not only as organizational issues but ultimately as vital political questions.</p>
        <p>Without a proper handling of the organizational question in its formative stage, the PSL could never realize its revolutionary goals and objectives. One only gets to plant the tree once. For it to grow strong and straight it must be planted correctly and with care.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="a2s2">
        <h2>ORGANIZATIONAL STAGES OF THE PSL</h2>
        <p>The PSL has developed far beyond the handful of cadre who began the organization. It has grown numerically and developed considerably in cadre formation. It has, in turn, evolved in terms of its organization.</p>
        <p>In a 1921 resolution on organization, the Communist International, a centralized grouping of all the revolutionary parties in the world, determined that: “There can be no absolutely correct, immutable organizational form for communist parties. The conditions of the proletarian class struggle are subject to changes in an unceasing process of transformation; the organization of the vanguard of the proletariat must also constantly seek appropriate forms corresponding to these changes.”</p>
        <p>When the PSL formed in 2004, it had no name, no structure, no Program, no Constitution, almost no money, no websites, no newspaper, no books and no magazines.</p>
        <p>At that time, the PSL held a two-part Founding Convention in which it established the basic foundation for the Party – a name, an internal structure and organization, initial publications and so on. National Conventions followed in the subsequent years, each followed by the election of a national leadership body with an executive to direct the day-to-day work of the Party between these Conventions.</p>
        <p>This was important in the early stage of the Party's development. It allowed all of the Party members to participate in discussions about the organization, evaluate the recent period and discuss how to move forward. Everyone worked together and made decisions together. It contributed to the leadership development of the members.</p>
        <p>After several years of National Conventions as the highest body of the Party, open to all members, the PSL took an important step in its development as a democratic centralist organization and began to hold delegated Congresses. Delegates to the Congresses are elected on a proportional basis from local PSL branches. The Congress delegates democratically decide, after thorough nationwide Pre-Congress discussions, on changes to the Party's Program and Constitution, as well as adopting new policies for the next period.</p>
        <p>The delegates also elect a Central Committee that will function as the national leadership until the next Congress convenes. According to the PSL's Constitution, a Congress must be held every two to three years. Delegated Congresses are able to combine elections and the wide expression of internal democracy with the formation of a more developed and accountable leadership.</p>
        <p>The First Party Congress in 2010 focused on the adoption of the Party's Constitution and its Program, the culmination of an intense full year of drafting and discussion within leadership bodies and among all branches.</p>
        <p>The Second Party Congress in 2013 built on the foundation laid at the First Congress. It was an opportunity to focus on the subject of the Party's strategic orientation – the establishment of organizational priorities and the selection of tactics in order to best achieve the goals outlined by the strategic orientation.</p>
        <p>Since then, the PSL has taken these decisions into a nationwide discussion involving every member in every city, at the branch and regional level, at a National Party Conference and Regional Party Conferences that are still continuing.</p>
        <p>This process of discussing, developing and implementing a strategic orientation has gone on for over a year and has involved every member. It is a reﬂection of the democratic centralist structures that the PSL has developed over the last decade, and has resulted in exciting new projects and initiatives that are being launched by the PSL on our 10-year anniversary and in the months to follow.</p>
        <p>A revolutionary party does not seek to replace the people – it is the instrument that the people use to make revolution. We in the PSL believe that it is a primary task of all revolutionaries to develop and strengthen this central tool in the struggle for socialism.</p>

      <section id="a3s1">
        <h2>FIGHTING FOR REFORMS WHILE POINTING TOWARD REVOLUTION</h2>
        <p>The Party for Socialism and Liberation is built on two essential premises. One is revolutionary Marxist theory and analysis on all issues aﬀecting humanity and the environment we live in, especially the most pressing issues facing workers and oppressed peoples.</p>
        <p>We strive through our literature, newspaper, social media, video, agitational leaﬂets, and more, to popularize and communicate to our class the truth behind the capitalists' lies and the urgent need for socialism.</p>
        <p>But theory and politics would mean nothing without struggle. That is the other essential premise of our organization. Action is the key to progress, the only way to defeat right-wing policies and win rights, and ultimately to achieve the liberation of humanity through socialism.</p>
        <p>Over the past decade, the PSL has been involved in numerous diverse struggles, far too many to list here. A few highlights follow.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="a3s2">
        <h2>CONFRONTING THE U.S. WAR MACHINE</h2>
        <p>When we announced the formation of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, it was during the ﬁrst term of the George W. Bush administration, 15 months into the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq and almost three years into the occupation of Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>The founders of our Party had been involved in the anti-war movement for decades, going back to the genocidal U.S. war against Vietnam. We were very active in founding and leading the ANSWER Coalition — Act Now to Stop War and End Racism — a truly anti-imperialist organization with a mass following that mobilized demonstrations in Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles of up to 500,000 people against the U.S. wars in the Middle East and South Asia.</p>
        <p>We did not agree with those in the anti-war movement who argued that the demand against the war should be conﬁned to “Bring the Troops Home.” In addition to ending the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, ANSWER called for an end to Israel's U.S.-supported colonial occupation of Palestine.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian people, long oppressed by U.S. and British imperialism and the Israeli colonial state, have for too long been ignored by the more liberal, moderate sectors of the movement.</p>
        <p>By including the Palestinian cause, as well as unequivocally opposing U.S. aggression in all of its forms, we proved through the massive turnout in many of the protests that a principled,
        anti-imperialist and internationalist position on Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan is by no means a drag on the movement. In fact, this is both an obligation of a revolutionary Party and helps to raise the consciousness of the people.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="a3s3">
        <h2>IMMIGRANT RIGHTS</h2>
        <p>In the spring of 2006, when the vicious anti-immigrant oﬀensive was unleashed through the “Sensenbrenner” bill in Congress, a huge mass movement arose quickly throughout the United States demanding full rights for undocumented workers.</p>
        <p>The bill was a real threat to all undocumented people and their families. If the racist bill had become law, people without “legal” status would have been liable for felony charges, simply for living and working in the United States.</p>
        <p>The Party for Socialism and Liberation threw all our forces into this struggle, joining with our sisters and brothers to demand full immigrant rights under the slogan, “Amnesty Now!” This was the main demand on the streets among undocumented workers and immigrant communities at the time.</p>
        <p>For several inspiring weeks, the power of one of the most oppressed sectors of the U.S. working class was shown, as immigrants deﬁed their bosses and the government to declare a general strike of the undocumented. PSL members helped organize and participated in the mass marches and rallies in cities and towns across the country.</p>
        <p>On May Day 2006, the largest demonstrations ever in the history of the United States took place. With millions of undocumented workers in the streets and absent from the workplace, whole industries had to shut down, including giant food-production plants, restaurants and stores.</p>
        <p>While the Sensenbrenner bill was dealt a smashing defeat due to the huge and militant
        ﬁght-back of immigrant workers, millions of undocumented people continue to be denied legal status and the struggle for justice goes forward.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="a3s4">
        <h2>RESPONDING TO HURRICANE KATRINA</h2>
        <p>On August 29, 2005, New Orleans and much of the Louisiana and Mississippi Gulf Coast was devastated by Hurricane Katrina.</p>
        <p>Making Hurricane Katrina's direct damage far worse was the racist and criminal neglect that followed the storm, causing thousands of deaths and disappeared people, and massive suﬀering for the African American and other poor communities in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>PSL and ANSWER Coalition members traveled to New Orleans to convey our solidarity politically and concretely, bringing what aid we could transport. We produced a video, “Heroes, Not Looters,” to counter the racist lie that people were committing crimes. Instead, we helped to expose the absolute criminality of the government that forced people to fend for themselves for weeks and showed that truly heroic feats were carried out by the poor.</p>
        <p>Against the oil companies, for environmental justice
        On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, owned by the BP oil conglomerate, exploded. It was followed by 90 days of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico, creating the most disastrous marine oil spill in history.</p>
        <p>The PSL was instrumental in creating the “Seize BP” campaign to demand the seizure of BP's assets. The campaign demanded that this seized wealth be used to immediately and fully compensate the millions of residents in Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Florida, Mississippi and the rest of the Gulf region and called for the criminal indictment of the BP executives and others responsible.</p>
        <p>Seize BP helped mobilize more than 50 protests, from California to Miami to Louisiana. The campaign gained national news and helped galvanize widespread anger into a major political force.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="a3s5">
        <h2>POLICE BRUTALITY, PRISONS, AND POLITICAL PRISONERS</h2>
        <p>An epidemic of police killings has terrorized working-class communities from New York to California and everywhere in between. The PSL has acted quickly to mobilize support for the victims' families and community, playing a critical role to keep the heat on the authorities and demand justice.</p>
        <p>Although there are many examples of PSL and ANSWER involvement in several cities, one stands out in recent weeks: Albuquerque.</p>
        <p>In the last four years, the Albuquerque Police Department has shot 26 people to death. On March 21, a video went viral of an unarmed homeless man, James Boyd, who was shot in the back in the city's foothills. Young PSL activists played a key role in organizing a militant mass protest of 1,500 people. Together with victims' families and other activists, they shut down the City Council proceedings and occupied the mayor's office, demanding action.</p>
        <p>The PSL has been active in the struggles for freedom for U.S. political prisoners, who have suﬀered decades of unjust persecution and imprisonment, including Mumia Abu-Jamal, Leonard Peltier, the Cuban Five, the Angola 3 and Oscar López Rivera. We are committed to their struggles until they are free, as well as ﬁghting the mass incarceration of millions of oppressed people in the United States.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="a3s6">
        <h2>FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY</h2>
        <p>From the formation of our Party, PSL activists have been deeply involved in the struggle for LGBTQ liberation. In November 2008, after the narrow passage in California of the reactionary and homophobic Proposition 8, PSL organizers were among those marching in the streets in the spontaneous outpourings of anger across California and the around the country, including civil disobedience actions. Currently, PSL members are leading the ﬁght for justice for “Jane Doe,” a 16-year-old Latina transgender girl who is in prison despite no charges being ﬁled against her.</p>
        <p>The mass movement demanding equal rights has been the key factor in the legalization of same sex marriage in more than 20 states since 2008.</p>
        <p>PSL members and supporters were very active in the Occupy movement that spread like wildﬁre across the United States, from staying nights in the camps to leading a “bank takeover.”</p>
        <p>Women Organized to Resist and Defend — WORD — has been active for more than a year to defend a woman's full reproductive rights and ﬁght for an end to violence against women. We are now mobilizing in support of Marissa Alexander, who faces being railroaded into Florida prison for defending herself from domestic abuse.

        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Trump declared last night from the White House that he would "end the riots" with a national military mobilization to "dominate the streets" and that "if a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary," he would "deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them."</p>
        <p>Minutes before he spoke, just a few hundred feet away outside, officers on horseback dispersed a peaceful protest with tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades. The crowd was chanting "hands up, don't shoot," with their arms pointing in the air, when the police riot began. Members of our organization were on the front line and sustained injuries from the stun grenades and bullets. Many protesters were arrested. Black Hawk helicopters buzzed over the marches in show-of-force operations. The helicopters kick up huge amounts of wind and dust, paralyzing people below, a tactic of the U.S. imperialist operations in Iraq and Somalia now migrating back home.</p>
        <p>Without a doubt, this marks a major turn towards a more open police state. The righteous rebellions against racism that have rapidly overtaken the country now face a difficult challenge. Trump intends to use brute force, and is threatening to drown that movement in blood. In the same speech, he invoked the defense of "second amendment rights" — which can only be read as a rallying cry for the armed far-right. Earlier this week, he said, "when the looting starts, the shooting starts." The Democratic mayors are playing along, declaring curfews that start as early as 6 p.m. to shut down the movement.</p>
        <p>Trump has declared war on this new people's movement. It is couched in the language of stopping "far-left extremists" and "rioters" — who Attorney General Barr promises will be charged as "domestic terrorists." But this is classic scapegoating; in fact, it is a declaration of war meant to suppress and quell the whole movement.</p>
        <p>This fascistic turn to militarily suppress protest and the exercise of free speech must be combated. The protests must continue. To stop now would be to embolden Trump's militarism and the far-right. The bravery and collective willpower to march on, shown in the streets of D.C., Louisville, Philadelphia, and so many other cities tonight, will not be easily broken.</p>
        <p>Trump's military crackdown may yet backﬁre. Even the corporate media that generally supports the curfews have condemned the extraordinary use of force to clear the area next to the White House, which was designed to create a photo opportunity for him to talk tough, Bible in hand, in front of St. John's Chapel. The bishop of that same Chapel called the police operation and Trump's use of her church as a backdrop an "outrage."</p>
        <p>But as we continue to struggle, now under more severe threats of repression, it is crucial to understand how events that have transpired in the last ﬁve days got us here.</p>
        <p>The most essential element of developing a strategy is to distinguish friends from enemies. The last week has shown that the movement has many fake friends who have laid the groundwork for Trump's announcement.

        <h2>FAKE FRIENDS AND REAL ENEMIES</h2>
        <p>The capitalist ruling class is a sophisticated force, with many diﬀerent instruments and tools. It was thrown wildly oﬀ balance and onto the defensive with the growing nationwide uprising, and was unable to contain the uprisings through traditional methods of repression and co-optation.</p>
        <p>Perhaps if the officers had been arrested quickly, these methods would have worked, but without the arrests and charges against the killer cops — which was the most basic demand of the uprisings — the movement grew and grew. The lip service of solidarity from the Democratic politicians was not enough. The ﬁring of the four cops in Minneapolis was not enough. The pleas to "let the legal system do its work" enraged people further, and the third-degree charge for Derek Chauvin was an insult.</p>
        <p>And so the movement continued to spread. Unable to contain this rebellion, the corporate media and political establishment of both parties worked to change the narrative. The primary strategy was to focus on the "outside agitators." With lightning speed, the liberal and conservative factions of the ruling class united around this talking point. From the "progressive" Democratic mayors up to Donald Trump himself, all have characterized the movement as "hijacked" by violent extremists, especially scapegoating anarchists and the far-left.</p>
        <p>Now Donald Trump calls for law enforcement's "total domination" of the streets, and brags of attacks against D.C. protests the likes of which "the District has never seen before."</p>
        <p>But it is the liberal bourgeoisie — the Democratic mayors and governors and congressional leaders like Nancy Pelosi — who have facilitated Trump's latest attacks. They invented and propagated all of the political justiﬁcations that Trump and Attorney General Barr needed. They, not the White House, imposed unjust curfews that now lay the basis for the mass arrests of people exercising their free-speech rights. The curfews strengthen the police state and normalize police violence, which will be focused on the new wave of anti-racist rebellion. These same Democratic politicians did absolutely nothing against the heavily armed, nearly all-white right-wing "reopen" protests, which took place at the height of the pandemic and which were in direct violation of the lockdown.</p>
        <p>That this Democratic establishment touts itself as the anti-Trump "resistance" is a complete joke. In truth, it has long been the velvet glove over the iron ﬁst of state repression.</p>
        <p>Nor can anyone pass over that so many rebellions are taking place in urban areas governed entirely by the Democratic Party. This is the main reason the Democratic Party is unable to present a political leadership that will satisfy the anti-racist movement — this movement is objectively rebelling against them as much as Trump! It is in the cities that Democrats govern where the recent police killings have taken place, where killings have gone on for decades without any justice, where gentriﬁcation has expelled Black people from their historic neighborhoods, and where budget cuts have hollowed out health services and education. No amount of rhetoric can cover up that record.</p>
        <p>Barack Obama published an essay lecturing protesters on how to make "real change," with more "speciﬁc demands for criminal justice" and electoral eﬀorts. But how can anyone take this advice seriously? His own administration made no "real change" over eight years of rampant police killings and mass incarceration — despite the massive Black Lives Matter movement and uprisings in Ferguson and Baltimore.</p>
        <p>So when Trump complains about the "weakness" of the Democratic politicians against the movement, he voices the sentiments of many within the corporate and ﬁnancial establishment who see that the Democrats' typical containment strategies are not working. At this stage, with the movement so widespread, with the feeling of rebellion capturing the minds and hearts of millions, only ﬁrst-degree murder charges for all the killer cops as well as the cessation of new police killings could potentially get people to go home and out of the streets. And the state refuses to concede this basic demand. So outright repression is their alternative.</p>
        <p>Most other governments around the world, even capitalist ones, would be preparing some sort of reform package in the face of over 75 militant rebellions in every urban center. Officials would be resigning, ﬁred, or criminally charged. Not in the capitalist United States — whose ruling class stands out not only for its level of viciousness, militarism and racism but also its extraordinary hubris. Even though the United States has all the material resources to enact widespread social and economic programs to improve the economic conditions of the working class, and to redress the grievances of Black people, it simply refuses to budge.</p>
        <p>They've oﬀered nothing but more police violence.

        <h2>NEVER A PRISTINE REVOLUTION</h2>
        <p>Revolutions are messy. They don't emerge out of normalcy but out of crisis. They are made amid a swirling pace of events, the confusion of contradictory information, the breakdown of order, the reshuﬄing of political allegiances, and the unleashing of new social forces who feel their power for the ﬁrst time. Many diﬀerent sides each try to put their imprint onto the larger convulsion, adopting new rhetoric and tactics, striking new alliances, deploying their agents of subterfuge and deception, all to steer things in the direction they want.</p>
        <p>This is how revolutions look in the real world. Anyone who expects a revolutionary movement to emerge fully formed, and for the process to unfold with just two sides, cleanly diﬀerentiated —where the good guys all line up one side and all the bad guys on the other and then battle it out until one wins — has adopted a cartoonish view of politics.</p>
        <p>The art of revolutionary politics is to try and stay ahead of events, to anticipate what is coming, to discern out of this commotion and confusion what is most essential, to identify our side's strong points and concentrate them on the state's weak points, and to understand our enemy and prepare ourselves for its counter-attacks. No movement can go from victory to victory; it can only grow strong by withstanding the state.</p>
        <p>First and foremost, the uprising has allowed hundreds of thousands of people, mostly poor and working-class young people, to feel their own collective strength for the ﬁrst time. The simultaneous release of all the pent up frustration and anger immediately outstripped the capacity of the state. That expanded their feeling of conﬁdence; the power of standing, marching, and taking action together against demands to go home; the solidarity of supporting one another as comrades in the face of armed repression; the inspiration of feeling the courage of the person next to you; the exhilaration of seeing the police, the bullies, ﬁnally in retreat. All this widened the horizons of the protests and made people more determined to ﬁght, and to demand more. Many people's consciousness about the character of the state has been transformed in less than a week through their own participation.</p>
        <p>While we unite with this movement, with all its contradictions and roughness around the edges, it is not sufficient to merge with the spontaneous movement.</p>
        <p>On the political front, we must combat the portrayal of the movement as divided into the two images of the "good protester" and the "bad protester." This has invited repression and the arrest of the "bad protesters" so as to push back the movement as a whole. This narrative serves to distract from the underlying social issues that produced this outpouring of anger. It works to deﬂect from the ruling class's own responsibility for the epidemic of police murder. And it serves to deny that the militancy of the uprisings is rooted in the accumulated experiences of oppression, especially concentrated against Black people.</p>
        <p>Is there inﬁltration of this movement? Yes. The police and federal authorities themselves have undoubtedly sent an untold number of agents into the streets, posing as protesters, to facilitate repression and sow division in the movement. We know this from our own experience in the last few days and the historical experience of all powerful social movements in the United States. Of course, there are anarchist and other political forces who are entering the protests with a particular focus on property destruction. As we said, revolutionary processes are messy. But the notion that the movement has been "hijacked" is totally wrong.</p>
        <p>This rhetoric of "hijacking" itself serves to create confusion and suspicion about what is going on in the streets. It is meant to invoke cynicism in the motivations of those in the streets, to create fear that sinister forces are at work. They are trying to tell those in the street that the amazing, almost sublime, feeling of unity and power they are experiencing is not genuine, is at the service of some dark or foreign agenda that you can't see. And if you aren't in the streets yourself, you are being taught to fear the movement.</p>
        <p>But the crucial task is to draw in wider layers of poor and working people to unite with the uprisings against racism — and to recognize this as a movement for the whole working class. We are only a few days in, but the current moment appears as an embryonic revolutionary crisis. It may be seen in retrospect as the dress rehearsal for an even larger one.

        <h2>DEEP CAUSES OF THE CURRENT CRISIS</h2>
        <p>It is not unusual in a revolutionary process that the masses of people would start with simple demands — in this case, justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and the victims of racist and police terror. Basic accountability. The same things that anyone else would be immediately arrested for, these cops should be arrested for. But without the demand being met, the class struggle itself dynamically accelerates the pace of events and the state of consciousness, and the struggle quickly grows to take on society's most fundamental and unresolvable crises.</p>
        <p>There are, after all, multiple crises converging. There is the COVID-19 public health crisis, which the government utterly failed to stem or even respond to humanely and competently. There is the overwhelming economic crisis — with 40 million now unemployed, 16 million jobs expected to be permanently eliminated, and a wave of evictions around the corner. During this massive economic destruction and three months of pandemic, the assets of the billionaires gained $434 billion. And then thirdly, there is the ongoing crisis of the serial assassination of Black people in America — the rate of which stayed constant from 2019 to 2020 despite the lockdown.</p>
        <p>All this creates a crisis of legitimacy for the capitalist state and the Trump government. The political system is in shambles. Very few people believe in it. The election itself is hardly talked about. The lockdown put a lid on the pot but also turned up the temperature; the water has now boiled over. The capitalist government's traditional methods for resolving grievances aren't working.</p>
        <p>Socialists need our own independent assessment of what stage we are in and what is most needed now. In our August 2019 Party Congress, the PSL set out its strategic vision for the coming period, predicating our organizing on the "actuality of revolution" — that is the eventuality of tumultuous and explosive times to come. We emphasized that in addition to the nonstop oppressive feature of U.S. capitalism — such as poverty and white supremacy — the system was on a collision course with regards to the climate, job destruction, and war that would open up such possibilities. Instead, there has been a global pandemic but the result has been the same.</p>
        <p>A big part of our task is to be fully engaged with the masses in rebellion right now. No one group can even pretend to lead such a mass movement that has exploded overnight. All revolutionary processes release the raw energy that has been long suppressed — and so we are seeing the manifestations of generalized mass anger, the destitute sectors who are utilizing this moment to take that which they have been deprived of, the young people who are coming of age in a society that oﬀers them no future. The "looting" and "violence" pales in comparison to the looting of the capitalist class and violence delivered daily by its state.</p>
        <p>These aspects of the rebellion must not be the ﬁxation of socialists, although we must tactically navigate these dynamics to both solidarize ourselves with the organic leaders of the uprising and avoid the clutches of the state. The fundamental thing that is transpiring is that youth from all backgrounds are marching together. The crowds are overwhelmingly poor and working class, as well as containing large numbers of proletarianized people of middle class origin whose futures are far less secure than that of their parents.</p>
        <p>Our conviction is that to make a revolution you have to build a revolutionary organization that stands shoulder to shoulder with those in struggle. We do not discourage militancy but look to the example of so many others before us who channeled that militancy and combativeness into disciplined organizations. To the emerging generation of revolutionaries who are looking to build this type of organization, we oﬀer our experiences building the PSL and our lessons from studying other revolutions.</p>
        <p>While we join the struggle in the streets, we demand an end to the qualiﬁed immunity for police officers, which allows so many to kill with impunity. We demand a cancellation of rents and mortgages for the duration of the pandemic — make the banks pay. We demand an end to all evictions and foreclosures. We demand a 100 percent guarantee of people's salaries for all those made unemployed. We demand a dismantling of the current racist policing system, mass incarceration, and institutions of America. This is the program we will ﬁght for, and with which we believe a broad section of the working class can be drawn into this movement.</p>
        <p>Dress rehearsals can lead to larger revolutions only if the lessons are learned. The U.S. military studies closely its victories as well as its defeats. It learns as it ﬁghts, and works to prepare itself for the next battles. The same responsibility falls on those of us who dream and ﬁght for a new system.
