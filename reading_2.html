      <h1>Proletarians and Communists / Chapter 2 of the Communist Manifesto</h1>
      <hr>

      <hr>
      <p>In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?</p>
      <p>The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties.</p>
      <p>They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.</p>
      <p>They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mold the proletarian movement.</p>
      <p>The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the diﬀerent countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. 2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.</p>
      <p>The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.</p>
      <p>The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.</p>
      <p>The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.</p>
      <p>They merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism.</p>
      <p>All property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions.</p>
      <p>The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favor of bourgeois property.</p>
      <p>The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the ﬁnal and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.</p>
      <p>In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.</p>
      <p>We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man's own labor, which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.</p>
      <p>Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.</p>
      <p>Or do you mean the modern bourgeois private property?</p>
      <p>But does wage-labor create any property for the laborer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which exploits wage-labor, and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labor for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labor. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.</p>
      <p>To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status in production. Capital is a collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.</p>
      <p>Capital is therefore not only personal; it is a social power.</p>
      <p>When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of society, personal property is not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social character of the property that is changed. It loses its class character.</p>
      <p>Let us now take wage-labor.</p>
      <p>The average price of wage-labor is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the laborer in bare existence as a laborer. What, therefore, the wage-laborer appropriates by means of his labor, merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence. We by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labor, an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labor of others. All that we want to do away with is the miserable
      character of this appropriation, under which the laborer lives merely to increase capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it.</p>
      <p>In bourgeois society, living labor is but a means to increase accumulated labor. In Communist society, accumulated labor is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the laborer.</p>
      <p>In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in Communist society, the present dominates the past. In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.</p>
      <p>And the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.</p>
      <p>By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free selling and buying.</p>
      <p>But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also. This talk about free selling and buying, and all the other "brave words" of our bourgeois about freedom in general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production, and of the bourgeoisie itself.</p>
      <p>You are horriﬁed at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.</p>
      <p>In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is just what we intend.</p>
      <p>From the moment when labor can no longer be converted into capital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of being monopolized, i.e., from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital, from that moment, you say, individuality vanishes.</p>
      <p>You must, therefore, confess that by "individual" you mean no other person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of property. This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and made impossible.</p>
      <p>Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labor of others by means of such appropriations.</p>
      <p>It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.</p>
      <p>According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything do not work. The whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology: that there can no longer be any
      wage-labor when there is no longer any capital.</p>
      <p>All objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products, have, in the same way, been urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating intellectual products. Just as, to the bourgeois, the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture.</p>
      <p>That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a mere training to act as a machine.</p>
      <p>But don't wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition of bourgeois property, the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom, culture, law, &c. Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all, a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class.</p>
      <p>The selﬁsh misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property – historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production – this misconception you share with every ruling class that has preceded you. What you see clearly in the case of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal property, you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of property.</p>      
      <p>Abolition [Aufhebung] of the family! Even the most radical ﬂare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists.</p>
      <p>On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form, this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things ﬁnds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.</p>
      <p>The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.</p>
      <p>Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents? To this crime we plead guilty.</p>
      <p>But, you say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social.</p>
      <p>And your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social conditions under which you educate, by the intervention direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, &c.? The Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the inﬂuence of the ruling class.</p>
      <p>The bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about the hallowed correlation of parents and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all the family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labor.</p>
      <p>But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the bourgeoisie in chorus.</p>
      <p>The bourgeois sees his wife as a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women.</p>
      <p>He has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production.</p>
      <p>For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.</p>
      <p>Our bourgeois, not content with having wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives.</p>
      <p>Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalized community of women. For the rest, it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and private.</p>
      <p>The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality.</p>
      <p>The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got. Since the proletariat must ﬁrst of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.</p>
      <p>National diﬀerences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.</p>
      <p>The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading civilized countries at least, is one of the ﬁrst conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.</p>
      <p>In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.</p>
      <p>The charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical and, generally, from an ideological standpoint, are not deserving of serious examination.</p>
      <p>Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's ideas, views, and conception, in one word, man's consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his social life?</p>
      <p>What else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.</p>
      <p>When people speak of the ideas that revolutionized society, they do but express that fact that within the old society the elements of a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.</p>
      <p>When the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient religions were overcome by Christianity. When Christian ideas succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge.</p>
      <p>"Undoubtedly," it will be said, "religious, moral, philosophical, and juridical ideas have been modiﬁed in the course of historical development. But religion, morality, philosophy, political science, and law, constantly survived this change."</p>
      <p>"There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all states of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience."</p>
      <p>What does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed diﬀerent forms at diﬀerent epochs.</p>
      <p>But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past ages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays, moves within certain common forms, or general ideas, which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class antagonisms.</p>
      <p>The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.</p>
      <p>But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.</p>
      <p>We have seen above, that the ﬁrst step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the battle of democracy.</p>    
      <p>The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organized as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.</p>
      <p>Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be eﬀected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of production.</p>
      <p>These measures will, of course, be diﬀerent in diﬀerent countries.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.</p>
      <p>1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes. </p>
      <p>2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.</p>
      <p>3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.</p>
      <p>4. Conﬁscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.</p>
      <p>5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.</p>
      <p>6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.</p>
      <p>7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.</p>
      <p>8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.</p>
      <p>9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.</p>
      <p>10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children's factory labor in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, etc., etc.</p>
      <p>When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organize itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.</p>
      <p>In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.

      <h1>The Weapon of Theory</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">January 1966</div>
      <div class="author">Amilcar Cabral</div>
      <hr>
      <p><i>The following is an excerpt from an address delivered to the ﬁrst Tricontinental Conference of the Peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America held in Havana in January, 1966.</i></p>
      <p>Those who affirm — in our case correctly — that the motive force of history is the class struggle would certainly agree to a revision of this affirmation to make it more precise and give it an even wider ﬁeld of application if they had a better knowledge of the essential characteristics of certain colonized peoples, that is to say peoples dominated by imperialism. In fact in the general evolution of humanity and of each of the peoples of which it is composed, classes appear neither as a generalized and simultaneous phenomenon throughout the totality of these groups, nor as a ﬁnished, perfect, uniform and spontaneous whole. The deﬁnition of classes within one or several human groups is a fundamental consequence of the progressive development of the productive forces and of the characteristics of the distribution of the wealth produced by the group or usurped from others. That is to say that the
      socio-economic phenomenon 'class' is created and develops as a function of at least two essential and interdependent variables — the level of productive forces and the pattern of ownership of the means of production. This development takes place slowly, gradually and unevenly, by quantitative and generally imperceptible variations in the fundamental components; once a certain degree of accumulation is reached, this process then leads to a qualitative jump, characterized by the appearance of classes and of conﬂict between them.</p>
      <p>Factors external to the socio-economic whole can inﬂuence, more or less signiﬁcantly, the process of development of classes, accelerating it, slowing it down and even causing regressions. When, for whatever reason, the inﬂuence of these factors ceases, the process reassumes its independence and its rhythm is then determined not only be the speciﬁc internal characteristics of the whole, but also by the resultant of the eﬀect produced in it by the temporary action of the external factors. On a strictly internal level the rhythm of the process may vary, but it remains continuous and progressive. Sudden progress is only possible as a function of violent alterations — mutations — in the level of productive forces or in the pattern of ownership. These violent transformations carried out within the process of development of classes, as a result of mutations in the level of productive forces or in the pattern of ownership, are generally called, in economic and political language, revolutions.......</p>
      <p>The foregoing, and the reality of our times, allow us to state that the history of one human group or of humanity goes through at least three stages. The ﬁrst is characterized by a low level of productive forces — of man's domination over nature; the mode of production is of a rudimentary character, private appropriation of the means of production does not yet exist, there are no classes, nor, consequently, is there any class struggle. In the second stage, the increased level of productive forces leads to private appropriation of the means of production, progressively complicates the mode of production, provokes conﬂicts of interests within the socio-economic whole in movement, and makes possible the appearance of the phenomena 'class' and hence of class struggle, the social expression of the contradiction in the economic ﬁeld between the mode of production and private appropriation of the means of production. In the third stage, once a certain level of productive forces is reached, the elimination of private appropriation of the means of production is made possible, and is carried out, together with the elimination of the phenomenon 'class' and hence of class struggle; new and hitherto unknown forces in the historical process of the socio-economic whole are then unleashed.</p>
      <p>In politico-economic language, the ﬁrst stage would correspond to the communal agricultural and cattle-raising society, in which the social structure is horizontal, without any state; the second to feudal or assimilated agricultural or agro-industrial bourgeois societies, with a vertical social structure and a state; the third to socialist or communist societies, in which the economy is mainly, if not exclusively, industrial (since agriculture itself becomes a form of industry) and in which the state tends to
      progressively disappear, or actually disappears, and where the social structure returns to horizontality, at a higher level of productive forces, social relations and appreciation of human values.</p>
      <p>At the level of humanity or of part of humanity (human groups within one area, of one or several continents) these three stages (or two of them) can be simultaneous, as is shown as much by the present as by the past. This is a result of the uneven development of human societies, whether caused by internal reasons or by one or more external factors exerting an accelerating or slowing-down inﬂuence on their evolution. On the other hand, in the historical process of a given socio-economic whole each of the above-mentioned stages contains, once a certain level of transformation is reached, the seeds of the following stage.</p>
      <p>We should also note that in the present phase of the life of humanity, and for a given socio-economic whole, the time sequence of the three characteristic stages is not indispensable. Whatever its level of productive forces and present social structure, a society can pass rapidly through the deﬁned stages appropriate to the concrete local realities (both historical and human) and reach a higher stage of existence. This progress depends on the concrete possibilities of development of the society's productive forces and is governed mainly by the nature of the political power ruling the society, that is to say, by the type of state or, if one likes, by the character of the dominant class or classes within the society.</p>
      <p>A more detailed analysis would show that the possibility of such a jump in the historical process arises mainly, in the economic ﬁeld, from the power of the means available to man at the time for dominating nature, and, in the political ﬁeld, from the new event which has radically clanged the face of the world and the development of history, the creation of socialist states.</p>
      <p>Thus we see that our peoples have their own history regardless of the stage of their economic development. When they were subjected to imperialist domination, the historical process of each of our peoples (or of the human groups of which they are composed) was subjected to the violent action of an exterior factor. This action — the impact of imperialism on our societies — could not fail to inﬂuence the process of development of the productive forces in our countries and the social structures of our countries, as well as the content and form of our national liberation struggles.</p>
      <p>But we also see that in the historical context of the development of these struggles, our peoples have the concrete possibility of going from their present situation of exploitation and underdevelopment to a new stage of their historical process which can lead them to a higher form of economic, social and cultural existence.

      <h1>Socialist Reconstruction, Introduction</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">October 2022</div>
      <div class="author">Party for Socialism and Liberation</div>
      <hr>
      <p>The capitalist system confronts the world with problems that capitalism is unable to solve: mass inequality, climate change, and war. Capitalism can't solve these problems because capitalism causes them.Billionaires get rich while millions sink into poverty. Fossil fuel corporations continue to drill and mine even as temperatures rise across the globe. The US government uses military bases, sanctions, bombs, and threats to pursue an aggressive imperialist agenda, even as it claims to stand for freedom and democracy. For the sake of people and the planet, we need a new system. We need a new society. What may have once seemed impossible is now an imperative necessity—socialism.</p>
      <p>This book presents the Party for Socialism and Liberation's proposal for the ﬁrst decade of socialism in the US in the twenty-ﬁrst century. In this vision, power is in the hands of the working class. The diverse multi-national working class has achieved political supremacy and is actively eliminating bigotry, racism, and national oppression as it expands economic, social, and political democracy. Major industries, corporations, services, and enterprises have been nationalized. Unions, cooperatives, collectives, and voluntary associations work together with public agencies to plan and coordinate production for the beneﬁt of people and the planet. The working class leads the project of reconstructing the United States.</p>
      <p>What will life look like in the ﬁrst ten years of a socialist US? How will socialism be better than what we have now? No one can predict every detail of a future socialist society. But we can demonstrate how socialism enables us to redress wrongs and address challenges, wrongs the capitalist class refuses to acknowledge, and challenges it is utterly unable to address because doing so threatens its wealth and power.</p>
      <p>Karl Marx describes the Paris Commune as the form through which the working class works out its own emancipation. Similarly, we think of socialist reconstruction as a framework for how we get free—equally free from exploitation, white supremacy, patriarchy, and imperialism; and equally free to share collective responsibility for meeting social needs and enriching social life. The chapters in this book sketch out central features of this socialist reconstruction: the end of wage slavery and domination by the capitalist market, the dismantlement of the structures of special oppression, the transformation of energy production and use, the provision of universal basic services, the expansion of free time, and the engagement of more and more people in the active reproduction of our common world.
      </p>
      <section id="a3s1">
        <h2>WORKERS MAKE THE WORLD RUN—WORKERS SHOULD RUN THE WORLD</h2>
        <p>Mainstream politicians in the US push a deceptive old Cold War image of socialism as shared deprivation. They want people to think that the capitalist system—where the billionaires get richer while the majority of working people end up struggling to survive—is the best we can do. With their messages ampliﬁed by capitalist media, Republican and Democratic leaders alike try to make people think that socialism means the government is going to "take our stuﬀ." What's so laughable about this view is that it's capitalism and the capitalist state that take "our stuﬀ." Workers produce the goods and services necessary for meeting people's needs, but we end up struggling to meet our own needs. Capitalism appropriates our labor, lives, and futures, chewing us up and spitting us out for the private beneﬁt of landlords and owners, banks, and billionaires.</p>
        <p>During the ﬁrst year of the COVID-19 pandemic, working people got infected and died, especially frontline "essential" workers who are disproportionately Black and Latino. We lost our jobs and were threatened with eviction, foreclosure, and homelessness. Hundreds of thousands of women were forced permanently out of the workforce and back into the drudgery of constant cooking, cleaning, and child care. Billionaires increased their wealth by 40 percent, proﬁting oﬀ the devastation inﬂicted on households and small businesses while intensifying the exploitation of warehouse and delivery workers. Before the pandemic, technology companies like Uber and Airbnb were already transforming the personal property of working people into the means of production for corporations—I drive my car and someone else gets rich. Corporations and the state bombard us all with fees and charges and rents and ﬁnes, hounding us to pay money we don't have and threatening us with lawsuits and sometimes even jail when we can't pay. The demands on workers never let up—not even during a pandemic that killed over a million people in the US alone. Forced to labor in crowded and dangerous conditions, we faced the impossible choice between getting sick and infecting our loved ones or sinking into debt and getting thrown out of our houses. Millions of us didn't even have this choice—we lost our jobs entirely.</p>
        <p>Together with the Republican Party, the Democrats have consistently betrayed working-class people, built up the massive US prison system, ampliﬁed and entrenched racial division and oppression, indebted students and households, pursued aggressive imperialist interventions across the world, and failed to use government to guarantee free and universal health care, education, child care, housing, transportation, and utilities. Much like their Republican opponents, the Democrats have proven themselves more interested in saving the banks than in saving the people and the planet. As long as Democratic leaders are oriented toward the interests and campaign contributions—of Wall Street and the corporations, they will serve and protect that class, not our class, the working class, the class of those who have to sell our labor power in order to survive. Working people cannot count on the Democrats to have our backs. We can only expect what we have already gotten: stabbed in the back.</p>
        <p>Everybody knows that this system of mass exploitation and oppression can't continue. More and more people are using "socialism" as the name for the solution. But what do they mean when they say "socialism"? In history and in the present, there are diﬀerent versions of socialism. The version presented here begins with the abolition of the tyranny of the market and the emancipation of the diverse multinational working class. Instead of being dictated to by a system rigged in favor of billionaires, capitalists, and landlords, we the people should determine what we need and coordinate a plan for producing the goods and services necessary to meet those needs. Workers make the world run, workers should run the world!</p>
        <p>Today, all production is socialized: nearly every product depends on the interconnected skills, labor, and contributions of many people, often from all over the world. It follows that the responsibilities for and the beneﬁts of production should be socialized, too. In the capitalist system, all the beneﬁts are
        privatized—the few proﬁt oﬀ the labor of the many. Decisions are made with an eye to the "bottom line" of making money, making sure that the rich are getting richer. The social and environmental impacts of this compulsion to accumulate are basically ignored. The only way to ensure that production serves people and the planet instead of having people and the planet serve production is to take it out of the hands of the capitalists and owners and place it into the hands of the collective people. Decisions about production and distribution have to be made democratically, by workers and communities, in accordance with a common plan. This is how we liberate ourselves from capitalist exploitation and market dependence.
        Too many jobs in the capitalist US are deeply alienating. Just as the assembly line replaced craft work, so today jobs in a wide array of services have taken the place of higher-skilled and better-paid jobs in industry. Whether low-waged jobs in fast food, transport, delivery, retail, warehouses, and call centers or higher-waged jobs in information services, human resources, insurance, or some other bureaucracy, much of the work in the US doesn't feel rewarding to those of us who are doing it. Because work is organized through a capitalist labor market, most of us have to work for wages in order to pay for the things we need to survive—food, transportation, medical care, housing, and so on. While some people are fortunate enough to get paid to do what they love, that privilege is unequally distributed according to class, race, and gender. Under capitalism, the majority of us spend most of our time doing work we hate so that someone else can get rich.</p>
        <p>When we are constantly worried about losing our jobs; constantly worried about making rent; constantly worried about making it to the end of the month; constantly worried about a medical emergency that could wipe us out; constantly worried about ﬁres, ﬂoods, and weather extremes; we aren't free. But we don't have to let market forces determine our lives and futures. After all, the ruling class doesn't: since they control the state, they ﬁnd ways to use the state to bail them out. So-called "free markets" are managed by central banks and elements of the state to protect corporations and maintain the position of the ruling class as a ruling class. In a way, this protectionism is already a kind of socialism, but it's socialism for the rich. What we need is socialism led by the working class for the beneﬁt of society as a whole.</p>
        <p>People can come together, coordinate needs with the skills and resources necessary to meet them, plan what we should produce, and collectively determine how to do it. Planning already happens at multiple levels and scales throughout society—whether we are talking about the US military, Walmart's massive distribution network, local government, school curricula, or a household's weekly budget. When planning doesn't happen—or when plans aren't followed—the results are calamitous. The preventable deaths of over a million people in the United States from COVID-19 demonstrated the disastrous consequences of the failure to coordinate a centralized response. Countries such as China, New Zealand, Japan, and Cuba didn't experience anything close to the magnitude of death ravaging the US because they combated the pandemic with proper planning, centralized leadership, and mobilized community messaging and organizations.

        <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE IS CLASS STRUGGLE</h2>
        <p>The last forty years have made abundantly clear what Marx and Friedrich Engels argued over a century ago: capitalism is as much a system of destruction as it is a mode of production. Proﬁt-oriented production leads to extraordinary excess and waste, squandering natural resources, and devastating the natural world. Overcapacity in some areas of production is accompanied by undercapacity in others. In some places, there is too much, and in other places too little. Competing ﬁrms make nearly identical versions of the same commodities, encourage consumers to buy what we neither want nor need, and even end up destroying unsold goods. In search of proﬁt, owners pay workers as little as possible, resorting to wage theft and reducing hours to avoid paying beneﬁts and overtime. Some companies invest in technology instead of people, ﬁnding new ways to monitor workers more closely and push us more intensely. Other companies stop making things altogether, preferring to buy back their own stocks and enrich their investors. And still other companies operate like birds of prey, swooping down to buy ﬁrms that they tear apart as they sell oﬀ the assets and discard the workers. From the demolition of communities, ways of life, and entire industries to the ecological devasta- tion inﬂicted upon the planet, production for the sake of private proﬁt is incompatible with the ﬂourishing of human and nonhuman life.</p>
        <p>The existential crisis facing us all is climate change, the steadily warming climate. The capitalist class can't and won't solve this problem. Decarbonization, eliminating our dependence on carbon-emitting energy sources, is necessary—an absolute imperative if there is to be a future in which the majority of the world's people and species will thrive. But eliminating fossil fuels is only possible if we decommodify and decolonize energy production and use, in other words, only possible if we abolish the proﬁt motive and ensure that all countries and communities have the energy they need to adapt to and ﬂourish on a warming planet. Meeting the energy needs of technologically advanced economies by means of renewables—wind, solar, and hydropower—is already possible, so long as industrial production is substantially reconﬁgured. We must also change our approach to food production and rebuild our housing and transportation infrastructure in more environmentally responsible ways. Life under socialism won't be the same as the popular image of straight, white, and middle-class life in the late twentieth century US—a way of life only ever available to the few and at the cost of exploiting and oppressing the majority of people in the world. Life under socialism will be better as everyone will be able to count on free health care, education, transportation, utilities, low-cost housing, more free time, and deeper engagement in determining our common futures.</p>
        <p>Adapting to the changing climate requires the reconstruction of the economy along socialist lines. A socialist reconstruction will shift from consumption-oriented commodity production to the production of universal basic services. From fundamentals such as free public transportation and guaranteed housing to conceptions of health and education expanded to encompass mental, sexual, social, and cultural ﬂourishing, a socialist economy takes oﬀ from and universalizes the gains capitalism hoards for the few. The goal of socialist production isn't private proﬁt or capital accumulation; it's advancing the conditions under which people and the planet can thrive. Instead of capital's world and soul-destroying drive for more money, more commodities, and more accumulation, the motive force of socialist planning will be developing the forms of associa- tion that reproduce a ﬂourishing social and ecological world.</p>

        <h2>SOCIALISM IS POSSIBLE AND NECESSARY</h2>
        <p>In the US, we already have the capacity to solve a wide array of social problems. Highly developed logistics systems such as Amazon's can be directed toward the elimination of hunger, with food and other necessities being distributed as needed. The elaborate databases used by real estate companies like Zillow can be deployed to connect houses with potential occupants, enabling us to eradicate the racist legacy of redlining and guarantee secure, comfortable, and attractive housing to all. The practices and infrastructure necessary for socialist planning are already in place, but they are in the wrong hands, the hands of the class of owners instead of the class of workers.</p>
        <p>Most contemporary socialists in the US agree with the imperative of ending exploitation and special oppression. They share the goals of pro- viding everyone with reliable access to quality health care, education, and housing. Programs like Medicare For All and the Green New Deal and movements to abolish debt and racist policing have grown in popularity because they articulate real popular demands for systemic change. This book proceeds from the conviction that these demands are realizable here and now. They aren't just a dream. Socialist reconstruction will make them a reality.</p>
        <p>What is necessary to make socialist reconstruction a reality is working- class power. If power over the state and economy is not in the hands of the multinational working class, then we will be forever ﬁghting for conces- sions that the ruling class will do its best to retract. We won't be able to move forward because we will constantly have to defend what we've already won. The capitalists and landlords will continue to invent new ways to keep us distracted, indebted, divided, and insecure, and we will end up forced to acquiesce to ongoing exploitation and oppression. But the crises of capitalism can't be addressed piecemeal—they are all related. Because US social democrats and democratic socialists focus on small gains while leaving the underlying system in place, they don't seem to believe their own program. For them, socialism is the music of a distant future. Along with millions of others across the country and around the world, we hear the music now—and believe we should all join in playing it.</p>
        <p>The following chapters show what the ﬁrst decade of socialism could be like in the US, how it is possible, and why it will create a better future for people and the planet. Anchored in an appreciation of all workers as unique human beings, our vision replaces capitalism's market determination of value via exchange with socialist values of meaningful, unalienated work and expanded free time.</p>
        <p>Workers are not line items on balance sheets, although that's what cap- italists reduce us to. Workers are unique human beings with hopes, needs, talents, and relationships that must be supported and cultivated. All labor that is necessary for society to function and achieve our collective goals will be recognized as meaningful, thereby overcoming alienation. Forms of labor that are currently seen as less desirable can be better distributed, more widely respected, and better compensated so that the burdens of such labor are socialized rather than foisted onto speciﬁc social groups who are underpaid and degraded. The only way to eliminate structural racism and sexism is by changing the structures. When diﬀerent forms of labor are shared, people learn to see and appreciate them, to understand, for example, where our food comes from, and participate in growing, pre- paring, and serving it. When everyone has a say in planning what needs to be done and when everyone does our part in carrying it out, we all learn to respect the work that goes into reproducing our society and meeting our needs. We also all get more time to pursue the things we love—as well as more time off.

        <h2>MEANINGFUL WORK AND MORE FREE TIME</h2>
        <p>In his classic account The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, Engels presents the determining factor in history as the production and reproduction of immediate life. As Engels explains, pro- duction involves making and securing means of existence such as shelter, food, clothing, and tools. Reproduction involves "the propagation of the species," that is, the work of caring for children and maintaining community relations. Throughout history, the organization of production and reproduction changes. In fact, history can be understood in terms of these changes. Important for our analysis here is the way that productive work became subject to wages with the development of industrial capitalism and capitalist agriculture. Instead of taking the proceeds of workers' labor by brute force (although this still happens), capitalists purchase the labor power of workers for a period of time (the price, length, and conditions of labor are always a matter of class struggle). Labor under capitalism is "alienated," for the proﬁt of another (the capitalist), and distributed via the market, which means the capitalist wants to buy it as cheaply as possible. The system is so twisted and unjust that some of the hardest and most necessary jobs receive the least compensation and respect.</p>
        <p>The rise of industrial capitalism also impacted reproductive labor. The domestic sphere ceased to be a site for the production of basic goods like cloth, soap, candles, and canned goods; these became industrially produced commodities. Since the care work associated with rearing children and tending a household held no immediate value in capitalist markets, women's position vis-à-vis men was devalued. A "cult of domesticity" reduced women's roles to those of wife and mother. That working-class women and enslaved women always worked for others outside their own households—often in grueling jobs requiring great strength and long hours—reveals the contradictory nature of the ideology that "a woman's place is in the home." As the formerly enslaved worker, abolitionist, and women's rights activist Sojourner Truth famously said, "Ain't I a woman?"</p>
        <p>Oriented toward the private accumulation of capital, the capitalist system undervalues or devalues most of the labor essential to the pro- duction and reproduction of life. From the standpoint of the capitalist, our labor is nothing more than an input into the process through which they make their money. In contrast, socialism recognizes and values as meaningful the work of producing and reproducing our social world. In a socialist US, most people will engage in both kinds of work, ending alienation and the devaluation of reproductive labor.</p>
        <p>Under socialism, productive work will be meaningful and unalienated because it will result from planning, that is, from collective discussion of values, priorities, and goals. People will understand work as contributing to larger social aims, such as the provision of healthy food, repair of vital infrastructure, regeneration of land and water, education of children, and enrichment of cultural life. The very experience of work will change as people have more control over their working conditions. Reproductive work will be recognized as occurring at multiple levels: caring for children and others in our households and families of choice, tending to rela- tionships in our community, and organizing and planning our common life. Here, too, planning will aﬀect a revaluation of emotional labor: the fact that we are always connected with others who depend on us and on whom we depend is featured in the ways we organize and socialize the tasks of everyday life. From the length of the workday or workweek, to the provisions for infant and child care, to the cultivation of voluntary associations and the creation of new social forms, under socialism, reproductive labor will be championed as essential and meaningful work.</p>
        <p>Like meaningful work, expanded free time—time to do with what we will—is a key component of the vision of socialism developed in this book. Workers, feminists, and environmentalists have consistently advocated for shorter working days and weeks. The labor movement brought us the eight-hour day. Shorter working days enable greater work-life balance, diminishing pressure on parents in the labor force, and improving physical and mental health. Reductions in labor time have environmental beneﬁts as they lead to decreases in carbon emissions and energy demands.</p>
        <p>Advances in technology and automation should have already led to shorter working days, a shorter workweek, and months of paid vacations. In some European countries, the eﬀorts of labor unions and social demo- cratic parties have secured these beneﬁts for many workers. This has not been the case in the United States, largely due to the particular ferocious- ness of the US capitalist class and its attack on anything that smelled of socialism. Because automation is developed under capitalist control, it hurts US workers more than it helps us. Exploitation and unemployment increase as some workers labor longer and longer hours, and others don't work at all. Instead of more free time for everyone, the result of capital- ist automation has been a larger reserve army of the unemployed and a smaller but overworked labor force. The dirty secret of the technology sector is that it runs on far fewer workers than the industrial economy required. Socialist planning will eliminate this contradictory and unfair approach to work. The beneﬁts of automation will be extended to all workers, decreasing the amount of labor time necessary for the produc- tion of goods and services. At the same time, the priority of involving everyone in production for the good of all, of letting everyone share in meaningful work, will have the happy eﬀect of increasing the amount of time available for us to do with what we will.

        <h2>A BETTER FUTURE UNDER SOCIALISM</h2>
        <p>A socialist reconstruction is possible in the United States—here and now. The technological and scientiﬁc means of production have advanced beyond what was scarcely imaginable one hundred years ago. The problem is that they are conﬁned within capitalist property relations; they are conceived as private property owned by the few. The very idea that a company or corporation is "private property" conceals its relationship to all sorts of people, practices, and resources outside its legal scope. For example, a company like Amazon relies on public goods and services like the US Postal Service, roads, and the internet. It presupposes that someone has paid to educate the people who come to be its employees. It also depends on someone somewhere ﬁnding something to do with all the boxes, packing materials, trash, and envelopes its service generates, what economists refer to as "externalities" for which the company doesn't pay but which have costs nevertheless. To use another example, pharmaceutical companies like Pﬁzer and Moderna received billions of dollars in public funding to develop coronavirus vaccines. Yet they patented the vaccines, claiming as their own private property not only what is clearly vital to the global common good but what was paid for by the tax dollars of working people. Relying on public money to fund private capital accumulation is standard operating procedure under capitalism. Risk is socialized and reward is privatized. The next and necessary step is to socialize rewards so that everyone beneﬁts, not just the few. And this means abolishing the legal form of private property that distorts collective ventures and socially produced knowledge into means for private capital accumulation.</p>
        <p>Across the United States, interest in socialism is growing. People may not know exactly what it means but most recognize it as the answer to the problems capitalism poses but cannot solve. The vision of socialist reconstruction presented here supplies a framework that demonstrates how socialism enables us to get beyond the contradictions of capitalism by decarbonizing and deprivatizing the economy and by reorienting production around universal basic services, meaningful work, and greater time to do with what we will.</p>
