      <hr>
      <p>As the economic cloud over the country continues to darken, the storm has already started to ravage the working class. The Department of Labor recorded 1.5 million new unemployment claims in 2008. An astonishing 586,000 people were thrown out of work just in January.</p>
      <p>NY Times 3-7-30The New York Times on March 7, 1930, the morning after a Communist-led unemployment march clashed with the police. Indicating how reforms are won from the state, the headlines read: "Reds Battle Police in Union Square" next to "City Asked to Rush Building Projects for Unemployed."</p>
      <p>Equally disturbing are the foreclosures. Over 3 million foreclosures were ﬁled last year, an 81 percent increase from 2007.</p>
      <p>Many workers are hoping that the new Democratic administration will turn this situation around. Liberal commentators in particular have been calling for a "new New Deal," hoping that the Obama White House follows in the footsteps of former President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his famous "ﬁrst 100 days" in office, Roosevelt created several agencies that focused on providing immediate relief for workers hit hard by the Great Depression.</p>
      <p>But no one in the bourgeois media has taken note of the political situation Roosevelt inherited: a period of increasing militancy, struggle and revolutionary consciousness among the working class. For activists hoping for progressive reforms, this is the real lesson to learn from the Great Depression.</p>
      <section id="a1s1">
        <h2>THE GREAT DEPRESSION</h2>
        <p>Economic crises always carry the possibility of becoming revolutionary opportunities. Times of economic hardship lay bare the fundamental injustice of the system. The ruling class is very class-conscious and knows this history very well.</p>
        <p>For the U.S. capitalist class, Oct. 29, 1929, was one of the most terrifying days in history. This was the day of the Wall Street Crash and the official beginning of the Great Depression.</p>
        <p>By 1933, it had left more than 11 million unemployed (around one-fourth of the labor force). With the ﬂood of the unemployed, millions were forced to wander the streets for food, eat out of trash cans and even steal to survive.</p>
        <p>Edward Rob Ellis described the severe conditions in his book "Nation in Torment." After a teacher asked a little girl in her class if she was sick, the little girl replied "No, I am alright, I am just hungry." The teacher then suggested her to go home and eat, but the child replied "No I can't. This is my sister's day to eat."</p>
        <p>While millions lost their jobs, their homes and were left to starve, the reactionary President Herbert Hoover largely sat on his hands, holding fast to the line that, "Joblessness should be dealt with by private and local agencies, not by the central government."</p>
        <p>During the Great Depression, the Communist Party-USA (CPUSA) emerged as the leading voice to press the economic and political demands of the working class. CPUSA members spent countless hours organizing, with no pay or reward, driven by their love for the oppressed and their desire to make a new society.</p>
        <p>CPUSA-led organizations, operating from the neighborhood to the national level, made economic hardship a political issue. They agitated in the streets and proved to workers that their problems were not due to individual failings. Rather, they were endemic to the economic system and were a reason to ﬁght.</p>
        <p>Two of the most important struggles led by the CPUSA at the onset of the Depression were the International Unemployment Day marches of March 6, 1930, and the First National Hunger March of December 1931.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s2">
        <h2>INTERNATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT DAY MARCH</h2>
        <p>As the economic crisis spread through all major capitalist countries, the Communist International called for March 6, 1930 to be the day for world demonstrations for the unemployed.</p>
        <p>The CPUSA immediately responded, urged all its members and supporters to organize for this day and demand unemployment insurance. They organized in unions, schools, street corners, sports clubs and everywhere people would listen.</p>
        <p>Organizers made very special eﬀorts to organize in the African American communities, where unemployment rates tripled that of white workers. As soon as it formed in 1930, the Upper-Harlem Unemployed Council's primary objective was to mobilize Black and white workers for the March 6 demonstration.</p>
        <p>When March 6 ﬁnally rolled around, the ruling class was on full alert. They had already spent weeks violently repressing smaller unemployed demonstrations and house meetings. The communists, however, would not be turned away.</p>
        <p>"All police on duty to avert violence at Red rally today," read the New York Times headline in the morning of March 6. The police attempted to scare protesters away by reporting to the media that the Communists intended to assassinate government leaders, blow up the New York Stock Exchange, and attack police officers with knives. On the day of the demonstration, the NYPD showed up at Union Square with machine guns, not to mention riﬂes and tear gas bombs.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, an estimated 100,000 unemployed workers came out that day in New York City. When they attempted to march to City Hall, the police attacked, injuring scores and arresting dozens more. Many were women and children.</p>
        <p>CPUSA leader William Z. Foster, who went to prison for six months for having organized the march, justiﬁed their actions, "Our committee demanded a parade permit, we pointed out that the queen of Rumania, [many] military butchers, and many capitalist organizations had been allowed to parade freely, but now the class that built Broadway was being denied the right to walk along it."</p>
        <p>Demonstrations were held not only in New York, but all over the country. New York and Detroit were the largest, but there were 50,000 in Boston and in Chicago, 30,000 in Philadelphia and Cleveland and more than 125,000 demonstrators in a total of two dozen other cities around the country.</p>
        <p>Although met with repression, the marches became the launching pad for a national movement of the unemployed. The marches catapulted the CPUSA as the outstanding leader of the masses of unemployed and also put unemployment insurance in the national spotlight.</p>
        <p>It was no coincidence that on the same day of the march, the Senate Commerce Committee ﬁnally scheduled a hearing to review an unemployment insurance bill. A little while later, the bill would pass.</p>
        </section>
      <section id="a1s3">
        <h2>THE FIRST NATIONAL HUNGER MARCH</h2>
        <p>The CPUSA led a series of struggles following the March 6 demonstrations. These included hundreds of big demonstrations, hunger marches and eviction ﬁghts, as well as anti-racist struggles in the Deep South. The CPUSA led the Sharecroppers Union in Alabama, and launched a nationwide defense of nine young African Americans falsely accused of rape in Scottsboro, Alabama.</p>
        <p>One of these eﬀorts was the First National Hunger March of December 1931. Its main demands were long-term unemployment insurance, emergency relief, shorter work days with no wage decrease,
        old-age pensions and immediate payment of bonuses to World War I veterans.</p>
        <p>The First National Hunger March was perhaps the best-organized march in the history of the U.S. proletariat movement up to that time. It was composed of 1,700 elected delegates who marched from all over the country. The march was to be carried out in four columns, starting from St. Louis, Chicago,</p>
        <p>Buﬀalo and Boston. The delegates traveled in trucks and autos; each truck had its captain and each column its governing committee and leader. Each column had its speciﬁc route, time and date of departure. Along the route, local Unemployment Councils organized support rallies and led their own delegates into the march.</p>
        <p>The march traveled with machine-like precision, ﬁnally culminating with all columns meeting up and arriving in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 7. The marchers were met at gun-point by a huge police presence at the steps of the Capitol. The police outnumbered the marchers three to one.</p>
        <p>Then the marchers proceeded to march to the White House to hand President Hoover their demands. Once again they were met with an even greater police presence. The march ﬁnally concluded with a march to the American Federation of Labor Headquarters, whose reactionary leadership backed Hoover's policy of opposing unemployment insurance.</p>
        <p>The First National Hunger March of December 1931 attained a great deal of national attention, and led to subsequent hunger marches over the next several years. By the time Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933, such working-class mobilizations had become routine. Radicals carried the lessons and organizing experience from these marches into the labor struggles that later formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations.</p>
        <p>The New Deal left a lot to be desired; it reinforced racial inequality and the special oppression of Black people, and it failed to eﬀectively remedy the economic crisis. But to the extent that it did grant helpful reforms to the working class, these changes came from struggle. Roosevelt understood the potential for greater social upheaval when he came into office. The question for activists today is not whether the White House will help us; the question is if we can make the ruling class tremble.</p>

      <h1>The Communists Nominate</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">July 1932</div>
      <div class="author">Joseph North</div>
      <hr>
      <p><i>The following is an article originally published in the Marxist magazine "New Masses"</i></p>
      <p style="margin-left:15px">Springtime, May, 1931: from Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C., ﬁrst subterranean rumblings of fascist dictatorship. Fleets of Maru craft, Jap liners, nosing from American ports after nightfall loaded to the waterline, machine guns, powder, cotton, death-gas chemicals. Another ten percent wage cut in steel. U. S. Steel eagerly up points on Wall Street ticker-tape, then the skids again. Two million dollars additional appropriated to deport more aliens from the U.S.A. in 1932. First time in American history tide of emigration overwhelms immigration. Wires jerk from Wall Street in preparation for Republican and Democratic quadrennial circuses. Ironclads swarming with Nipponese mercenaries rolling down the Sungari to Siberian border. Socialist Party haggles on beer. Machine-gun rat-rats death in Melrose Park, one month past Ford's Dearborn. Seven black boys behind steel bars in sunny Alabama wait for word from Supreme Court in Washington. Ragged veterans of Great War commandeer freight trains, swarm hungry over desert-lands, prairies, en route to imperial Washington-aid? Or death? Twelve million plebeians roaming for work-aid from Washington? Or death?</p>
      <p>DEATH scrawled in big letters across the map of the U.S.A. today, 1932-May-Springtime.</p>
      <p>The sun had dipped behind the shed of the Georgia farm two hours before when the Negro sharecropper, Comrade X (his name must be withheld for obvious reasons) nervously peering up and down the roadway, stepped from his farm and headed toward town.</p>
      <p>He glanced at the silhouettes of young corn, palegreen in moonlight: heeded the mule's stirring in the stoop-shouldered barn: waved farewell to seven silent dark ﬁgures on the steps of his
      shack, and disappeared around the bend in the road. He carried one clean shirt in a package tied about his belt, and now and then bent down to ﬂick dust from the cuﬀs of his seven year old Sunday suit.</p>
      <p>He passed an obscure bend in the railway road-bed in the drab Georgia ﬂatlands; thirty miles out from Atlanta. A Negro had been lynched-burned to death-here thirty-two years ago. "A</p>
      <p>"smart nigger" whose corpse was discovered charred across a touldering pile of ties.</p>
      <p>This murder, No. X in the list of 5,167 American lynchings since 1872, was mentioned in a casual line in the Atlanta Constitution;</p>
      <p>"Unrecognizable negro found." White foremen on the railway read the line and whispered, "One smart nigger less."</p>
      <p>That lynching occurred in 1900: today, May 17, 1932, the sharecropper,
      Comrade X, carefully took a wideabout route around his landowner's mansion. His head swarmed with the Communist Nominating Convention, 1,200 miles oﬀ, toward which he headed. Carefully folded in his inside coat pocket-a month old copy of the Daily Worker. The sight of a long train of freight cars, the locomotive plaintively sounding the siren-remember the Scottsboro boys! When the train turned the bend, he leaped forward, his long, black body pounding upward, and swung himself onto the freight.
      Reaching Chattanooga, he made his way to the appointed meeting place, and boarded the bus with the group of
      Southern workers chosen to go to the Communist convention.</p>
      <p>(These facts he related to me in the Coliseum while the forest of red banners waved to and fro, like banners of an approaching army: while a Negro stood on the platform before the massed
      tiers of 15,000 heads, black and white, and accepted the candidacy of vice-president on the Communist ticket. The Negro on the Platform, James W. Ford, was the grandson of that Negro who was lynched a few miles from the home of Comrade X. I glanced at Comrade X's face: lean, bony, the cheekbones high, like an East Indian, because the skin was drawn close to the scalp, the glowing eyes sunken).</p>
      <p>I spoke to the other delegates: the 100 % ers from Kentucky, who told me in their Elizabethan English of the terror drag-nets they had eluded to reach here: the Norwegian farmer from North Dakota, lanky,
      icy-eyed; the machinist from Des Moines, "my people got there in covered wagons and settled": to the blue-scarred miners from Western Pennsylvania pits, Slavic, narrow-eyed, built like potato-sacks: to dozens of the 930 delegates from forty-three states. Flavor of America-you can't say, 'Why don't you go back where you came from?' to these people-for only thirty ﬁve delegates were born in other lands.</p>
      <p>I ask Comrade X-"Wasn't it hard getting here?""Hahd ?" he asks, shrugging his lean shoulders, "Hahd? A reckon we got here lak homing pigeons . . "
      Like homing pigeons!</p>
      <p>We had arrived on the "Red Special": awakened at 1:30 a. m. in Dayton, Ohio, by shouts-"We want Foster and Ford!" Two hundred workers had waited ﬁve hours, ﬂagging every train,
      seeking the "Red Special". Chicago: it doesn't ﬂash on you like</p>
      <p>Manhattan's cliﬀs and canyons. It sneaked up, stealthily: the Indiana plains began to thrust steel mills into your face in the dawn: the ﬂat farmlands suddenly snarled with the black teeth of smokestacks-and then, Chicago. Chicago, I thought, and the jarring wheels seemed to sing," Capone Melrose Park</p>
      <p>Haymarket race riots 1919 South Side steel packing steel packing machine guns Insull Capone Capone Capone ... "</p>
      <p>Chicago: cameramen perched on ladders. The Internationale rises oddly in the blackened station. The delegates warmly grasp the welcoming hands of workingmen and workingwomen (you immediately note more Negro faces, many more Negro workers comparatively than ever before) in the crowd greeting you. A tall slim Negro in a cap sliding over his right ear, vigorously waving a red banner with a hammer and sickle.</p>
      <p>William Z. Foster.
      Communist candidate for president</p>
      <p>"The most famous man in America outside of Who's Who" J. P. Morgan's New York Post termed him that day in 19:30 when the trio of Tammany judges sent him up for six months on Welfare Island. His crime? He has said his long foreﬁnger pointing the way, "Then let us go to the 110,000 jobless on Union Square, March 6, leading the march on the City Hall for relief.</p>
      <p>"Foster for president". Three years of schooling. Son of a Taunton, Mass., cab washer. In the shop at the age of ten. Typefounder: factory-worker: steam engineer: sculptor's apprentice: steamﬁtter: railroad man: street car motorman: longshoreman: farmer: sailor.</p>
      <p>"Foster for president." 400,000 steel workingmen abandoned the furnaces in 1919; revolt: "We want to live like men!": Foster, their leader. 45,000 coal miners of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio, marching under the banners of the National Miners Union of the Trade Union Unity League, in 1931: Foster, secretary of the T.U.U.L., on the ﬁeld of battle twenty-four hours out of every day during the long, bitter war with Andrew Mellon's pool-room and slum-begotten guerillas.</p>
      <p>"Foster for president"—the A. F. of L. Mussolinis tried to put him on the spot in this same Chicago in 1926 at Carmen's Hall. The gunman missed aim as Foster, erect on the platform, taught the principles of the Trade Union Educational League, against the brigandage of the A. F. of L. mercenaries. The A. .F. of
      L. has good reason to hate him: this lean-faced, keen-eyed working-class leader-" They couldn't buy him oﬀ."</p>
      <p>"Foster for president."</p>
      <p>He stood before the massed 15,000: men, women and children straining forward in their chairs, hanging on every word.</p>
      <p>(Outside, Chicago beer ﬂeets delivered their ware while bluecoat sentries guarded: Chicago's Insull, Midwest Utilities Rock of Gibraltar among investments, crumbling, collapsed under water: Chicago, gearing up for the Republican and Democratic conventions).</p>
      <p>He stood and spoke: "I accept the nomination of the Communist Party for president of the United States. I shall try to be worthy of this high honor. One thing is certain .. • ."--the delegates of the American</p>
      <p>working-class, silent as a glacier, heeding every syllable "before long a Communist will stand at the head of the American government, a Soviet government."</p>
      <p>Strange, powerful prophetic words ... bourgeois newspapermen at the press table shiver a little ... "the American government," they jot it down. The representative of the Associated Press involuntarily turns to look at the delegates behind him. Involuntarily also he cringes as they surge forward, a tidal wave: on toward the platform: Foster rode high in the air on the shoulders of powerful workingmen, white and Negro. They bore him around the hall simultaneously with Ford.</p>
      <p>The red banners shook like sapling trees, trembling in a great wind. Negro and white, Latin from Florida and Colorado, Finn from Minnesota and New England, 100%ers from two score states, saw the dawn of a new world in the proceedings.
      "Foster and Ford!"</p>
      <p>"Foster and Ford! Foster and Ford!" the echoes thundered as they bore the two men around the auditorium, workingmen's children, women and men, clutching up at them as they passed by.</p>
      <p>Ford.
      For vice president.</p>
      <p>"The Communist Party," the taciturn, big-handed Hathaway, manager of the Communist Election Campaign National Committee, declared, "has decided to recommend an action by this convention never before taken by any national political party. We propose as candidate for vice-president of the United States a Negro ·worker, a leader of the oppressed Negro people."</p>
      <p>(Were there earthquakes at that moment in the Black Belt? Did the courthouse in Scottsboro, Alabama, fall to its foundations?)
      Caucasian and Negro wild-faced in joy: the red banners again waving like saplings in a hurricane … "Black and white, unite and ﬁght ... "
      "Black and white, unite and ﬁght . " the children chanted in the galleries.</p>
      <p>"We make this proposal not with a vote-catching motive. W.e do it because it corresponds to the fundamental position of the Communist Party and of those who support the Communist Party on the Negro question ... we stand for complete unconditional equality for the Negroes ... not equality in some narrow limited sense, but for complete economic, political and social equality ... we stand for a solid ﬁghting· front of all toilers Negro and white, to force the granting of such equality now . . . to march forward to the emancipation of all those oppressed by the yoke of capitalist rule ... "</p>
      <p>A reporter for the Negro bourgeois Chicago Whip tried to sneer but succeeded only in trembling: the Negro delegates sat upright, straight as a bolt, some of them dabbing at their eyes: the white workers hearkening to every word ...</p>
      <p>"In the ﬁrst place it i"s our demand that the land of the Southern white landlords, for years tilled by Negro tenant farmers, be conﬁscated and turned over to the Negroes. This is the only way to ensure economic equality for tenant farmers ... " .. (Not in vain did you fall before the massed guns of the sheriﬀ's mob, Ralph Gray, of Camp Hill, Ala., sharecropper). " ... we propose to break up the present state boundaries and to establish the state unity of territory in what is known as the 'Black Belt' where the Negroes constitute the overwhelming majority ... we demand that in this territory, Negroes be given complete right of self determination as they see ﬁt, the right to separate from the United States if they wish ... with these demands for Negroes, with the revolutionary white and Negro workers in the forefront of the struggle, the unity of the white workers, small farmers and Negro masses can be soon established ... "</p>
      <p>Ford for vice-president!</p>
      <p>James W. Ford, born in Pratt City, Ala. Son of Lymon Ford, 35 years a coal miner and steel worker in the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Co. domain. His grandfather lynched in Gainesville, Ga.-his crime-a "smart nigger". A man, a working man, who spoke out against the new slavery . . . they found him, a charred remnant of a human being, burned to death on a pile

      <p>Ford ... deported from Austria in 1931 by the socialist chief police, ... Ford, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the United States of America.</p>
      <p>Ford for vice-president. "Symbol of our program ... "
      "FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA A NEGRO ... "</p>
      <p>I sought out Comrade X while Ford was speaking. He told me of secret meetings in the dead of night—oﬀ in the woods, of sharecropper guards who must keep the vigil which means life or death to the gathered share-croppers. He stopped for a moment when Ford said, "In this so-called democratic United States, which is at the peak of capitalist culture, the white ruling classes carry out the most shameless oppression of 12,000,000 Negroes, jim-crow and persecute them and on every hand deny them the most elementary human rights. Negroes exist as a nation of "social outcasts" in in this country. This is the status of Negroes seventy years af- ter so-called emancipation."</p>
      <p>"Emancipation," muttered Comrade X. "Emancipation." Later : he told me more of his story: forty-nine years of sharecropping; six children waiting for his return in the three room frame shack that's home. He introduced me to his friend, Claude Patterson, father of Haywood Patterson, one of the Scottsboro boys. He mopped his forehead with the back of his hand as he spoke. His face, also lean, bony, gray streaked with black in his hair, his hands long and black hovered like crows while he spoke: "Oh, it's hahd to live down there, comrade", he said. "Awful hahd. You jes about lak a rabbit mongst a gang o' guns." He told of his boys
      -his ﬁrst-born, awaiting death on the electric chair.</p>
      <p>"My boy is treated awful brutish . . . prison guard keeps him in cell eight feet long and four feet wide ... terrorizin' the boy showin' him the 'lectric chair every day ... "</p>
      <p>He has ﬁve more children at home in Chattanooga. They must do what is called "living" on the $4.40 a week wage he gets from the steel plant in which he works "in nothin' but overall, no shirt, 'cause the sweat run down you too heavy."</p>
      <p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People "aimed to cotch him"; "William Pickens and ﬁve Chattanooga preachers" tried the job. After hearing their story he showed them the door. "Ah ain't interested in your line o'-talk" he said, "Mr. Pickens, you can show me where the sun rises and where it goes down, but you cain't talk me out o' believing in the International Labor Defense and the Reds." He shook his head, the hawks of hands nervously ﬂying. "The I. L. D. was more advanced to me. Even if my boy dies I know they made a ﬁght to save him. Big ﬁght ... and I'll back them even if I gotta die doin' it." He wiped his forehead again with the back of his hand.</p>
      <p>"I know this" he said, while the children in the galleries chanted, "Black and white unite to ﬁght"; "Even if my boy Haywood dies, the ﬁght the I. L. D. and the Communist Party made for him, means my youngest won't be as like to be strung up to a roof when he grows up."</p>
      <p>Blood-red banners stretched from girder to girder in the convention hall. The slogan in three-foot high letters cried out:
      VOTE COMMUNIST FOR THESE DEMANDS!</p>
      <p>1. UNEMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL INSURANCE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE STATE AND EMPLOYERS<br>(What do you say to that, you 15,000,000 jobless, daily watching the cheeks hollow into death of your children, your wives?... you on the breadline that curls like a question mark across America from coast to coast, what do you say? ... you dying amid the pyramids of wheat burned to keep prices high in the Pit, what do you say?)</p>
      <p>2. AGAINST HOOVER'S WAGE CUTTING POLICY<br>(You, reading that little white sign tacked on the wall near the blast furnace . . . "Due to present conditions . . . wage cut of 10% starting immediately"-what do you say? ... you American workers on the job slashed 60% in wages since the Wall Street earthquake November, 1929, what do you say? You staggered workers who heeded Messrs Green and Hoover in their agreement "No strikes, no
      wage-cuts"-what of that demand?)</p>
      <p>3. EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR THE POOR FARMERS<br>WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT AND BANKS: EXEMPTION OF POOR FARMERS FROM TAXES, AND FROM FORCED COLLECTION OF RENTS AND DEBTS.
      (You, man of the hoe, the man they ask in Congress to plow every third row under ... what do you say? You of the countryside, you farmers of England, Ark., starving while across the ﬁelds they're burning wheat to keep prices high in the Pit . . . what about it?)</p>
      <p>4. EQUAL RIGHTS FOR THE NEGROES AND SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE BLACK BELT<br>(Nation of Negroes in the United States ... 12,000,000 in the ﬁeld and foundry ... "ﬁrst to be ﬁred and last to be hired" ... jimcrow and lynch law ... Scottsboro, Camp Hill ... the rope
      and faggot .... the bullet ... the noose for the upright head …your answer?)</p>
      <p>5. AGAINST CAPITALIST TERROR: AGAINST ALL FORMS OF SUPPRESSION OF THE POLITICAL RIGHTS OF THE WORKERS<br>(Tom Mooney, dean of class war prisoners, staring across the blue waters at San Quentin, peeling potatoes sixteen years for the guards ... framed-up ... the 'plunderbund' got you ... and you, J. B. McNamara, and you Centralia boys ... and you 100 % Americans of the Kentucky mines . . . gun-thugs and machine guns when you meet ... when you talk organization ... what about it?)</p>
      <p>6. AGAINST IMPERIALIST WAR: FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE AND OF THE SOVIET UNION<br>(You, world war vets, rotting oﬀ in hunger, ﬁghting across country for the bonus "back wages" . . . you kids playing ball on the lot in a • thousand American cities, cannon fodder for the next war ... you haven't heard of the secret orders to print 32,-000,000 draft blanks? ... you haven't heard of the war plans ... the buzzards' heads are close together ... the Japanese troops are swinging on to the Soviet borders . . .
      Wall Street encouragement, munitions from New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Newport News, Frisco, Seattle ... war ... war ... war      )</p>       
      <p>Vote Communist for these demands?
      You millions out there—what about it, fellow workers?</p>
      <p>Outside the nominating convention hall, you could almost see--as the words of the workingmen delegates portrayed them-the ﬁfteen million ragged Americans: walking up and down the streets in the eternal hunger-picket, seeking jobs, hunting bread in ash-cans for their families. You could see the bent backs of the "leetle cheelderen" in the Colorado beet ﬁelds, "moving like snakes through the beets in the hot, burning sun," as Moses Rodriguez, ﬁfteen year old delegate from the striking Colorado agrarian workers said softly from the tribunal. You could see the vivid Latin faces of the Florida tobacco workers calling for "Defense of the USSR" under the muzzles of the Vigilance Committee guns ... the
      coal-streaked faces of the miners emerging from the pit to ignite in rebellion here ... their families at home living on herbs and ﬂour ... could see the monster millions of American workers seething forward and back, like sands on the beach before giant waves. And to these millions Foster said, " ... in making these immediate demands, the Communist Party never forgets that its tasks is to organize the workers for their revolutionary goal ... such measures constitute only relief, not cure for the ills from which the toilers suﬀer ... capitalism must be overthrown, the industries and land socialized, exploitation abolished, and Socialism established ... that is the only cure for poverty, unemployment, economic crisis, fascism, war and the rest of the miseries of capitalism. The Communist Party ﬁghts to establish a workers and farmers government, it struggles" and here
      the tumult rose to a cataclysmic pitch," ever and always for a United Soviet States of America."</p>
      <p>During a few moments recess in the convention I cornered Ford, and on behalf of New Masses asked his opinion of the role of sympathetic writers and artists in this period . . . the tasks of the John Reed Clubs .
      . . of those intellectuals whose eyes are on Soviet Russia, not too purblind to see that the workingmen of the world are rising …</p>
      <p>A broad-shouldered man, Ford bent forward. He said, ''The New Masses must try to develop a corps of proletarian writers out of the raw material in a thousand cities and farms of the country. The dearth of these today is a great shortcoming on the cultural ﬁeld of our struggle." He spread his palms. "Among the Negroes, for instance, who is there besides Langston Hughes?" he asked . "Particularly among the Negro proletariat will we discover those talents necessary for building up the intellectual opposition to the traitorous leadership of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and similar groups. Many honest intellectuals among the Negroes do not yet recognize the role of the Pickens, Whites, Du Boises, the McKinneys, Millers, Calvins, and Schuylers. True, the Scottsboro case has been the beginning of the end for these turncoats; but they still possess great potentialities for misleadership.</p>
      <p>"Take the war propaganda being carried on among the Negro masses today"-he spoke angrily. "Our friend Pickens, a hearty endorser of the propaganda that Japanese imperialism represents the interests of the darker races against the whites. Deliberately attempting to poison the Negro masses against the idea of unity of white and black toilers: a traitorous plan of lining up the Negro masses in the U.S.A. against the Soviet Union-the only country in the world where the national question has been solved; where the right of self-determination was advanced to 182 various nationalities, many of them non-white races; where complete equality obtains. I have been in the Soviet Union and have seen this: and it was then that I understood absolutely that the right of selfdetermination must be applied in the American Black Belt: that the Negro toilers must gain the right to control this land, this territory, and remove white ruling class domination, the real basis of the exploitation and suppression of the Negro masses…</p>
      <p>"But to get back to the need for proletarian writers," he said, "the Scottsboro case particularly has shown the tremendous need for combatting writers of the prostituted press, particularly among the Negroes. Those lying articles of Pickens and Walter White and that gang, saying that the responsibility for the Alabama lynch-verdicts is due to the propaganda of revolutionary working class organizations and not to the ruling-class murderers . . . that's got to be fought day in and day out: and not only on the arena of the factory, street and home, but on the printed page, which has such great power today. We must build our own press: develop our own writers: portray our own program clearly, simply, eﬀectively, so that the power of the high-priced liars of the bourgeois press is completely combatted."</p>
      <p>In the latter hours of the convention I sought out Foster: his lean face, haggard but lighted with enthusiasm. "What do you think of it?" He inclined his head toward the delegates. "Ever see such spirit?"
      I asked the same question I had asked Ford. Foster shrugged his shoulders. "It's a great task they have
      ... a big job ... "</p>
      <p>"We must recognize," he said, "that the chief aims of bourgeois culture, so far as it is directed toward the working-class are to develop the workers into robots who uncomplainingly accept whatever standards of life and work the owners of industry see ﬁt to grant them.</p>
      <p>"In so far as this culture is directed to the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, it results in a mass production of capitalist intellectual robots. In no country is culture so debased by capitalism as in the United States. This the John Reed Clubs must recognize and battle against. In no land in the world is it so sterile, hypocritical, colorless, lifeless.</p>
      <p>"Proletarian writers must be developed to combat America's capitalist writers, engaged in trying to convince the working class what a glorious thing it is to be a wage slave. They must expose and put to endless shame those artists and poets so busy glorifying Heinz's pickles and the advertising pages of the Saturday Evening Post: those dramatists and musicians who are cooking up patriotic slush and idiotic sex stories to divert the masses from their troubles, and the hopeless monotony of capitalist life: those scientists trying to prove the unity of science and religion."</p>       
      <p>Somebody from the presidium came into the room. "You're wanted out on the platform, Comrade Foster" he said. In the hall tremendous cheering. Foster jumped up, but halted as he was going out the door:</p>
      <p>Outside they were clamoring, "Foster and Ford-Foster and Ford."</p>
      <p>A Chicago delegate had invited us to his home the second day of the convention. "The light's been turned oﬀ," he said, "But if you comrades don't mind that, we got a couple of beds. Might as well make use of them before we're turned out completely."</p>
      <p>We spoke of the things all workers talk about: wages, the wife and kids, what there is to eat at home, what the goddamned government's doing about it, and, since 1917, about Soviet Russia.</p>
      <p>The sharecropper, a husky, round-faced Negro with a booming bass voice, told his story. The candle light ﬂickered high as it approached its last inch, and then darkness. ·The sharecropper went on telling his story. We couldn't see each other. Only there were red glows in the dark from our pipes.</p>
      <p>
      The Kentucky delegate spoke. "The gun thugs,'' he said, "they gun thug walking half a mile oﬀ. They don't like to get outta wears steel vests. When they walks they clink. You \can hear a their cahs. They won't talk onless they got the draw on you." , He recounted the stories we had learned too well: of Harry Simms' death: the shooting at Evarts: the ﬂux, 'bleeding at the bowels': the walls with cracks (you can call youah dog through) : the Red Cross that feeds scabs but not strikers-one falling under the cate' gory of an Act of God and the other existing without God's grace.</p>       
      <p>The Jugo-Slav tamped his pipe. He spoke without articles: like all Jugo-Slavs. "It's getting to be like in Jugo-Slavia" he said. "My brother write me from there. He told of friend who was caught distributin' leaﬂets for Reds. They took friend to police station: they beat him with leather whips: they beat him with ﬁsts: they beat him till he drop on ﬂoor. But he wouldn't tell who his friends were in Communist Party.
      You know what they do then?</p>
      <p>"They throw water on him: bring him to. Then," and his voice fell in the darkness to a bare whisper, "they say they give him one more chance. He keep his mouth shut. They take razor. And swish: they cut. He give one scream: ﬁnish." He resumed his pipe. "In America now: almost same."</p>      
      <p>In the morning we shook hands again.</p>
      <p>"Good-bye, comrade" the Kentuckian said; and he left to make his way to the Cumberland hills, where the gun-thugs clink when they walk.</p>      
      <p>"Good-bye, comrade, " the Jugo-Slav steel worker said with a grin, "I remember dam' good. Send me letter sometime."</p>
      <p>They shook hands all around once more, and left for various points of the compass of class-struggle. Each sported his red delegate's badge on his lapel; even though the convention had adjourned.</p>
      <p>On the train back to New York I thought of them. They had made their way here "lak homing pigeons" Comrade X had said.</p>
      <p>Like homing pigeons cleaving the air in a bee-line they were returning with the message of the Communist convention east-west -north-and south.</p>

      <h1>Toward a third Reconstruction: Lessons from the past for a socialist future</h1>

      <p><i>The following excerpt from a longer article published in Liberation School</i></p>
      <section id="a3s1">
        <h2>THE FINAL CHARGE</h2>
        <p>"It was not until after…that white labor in the South began to realize that they had lost a great opportunity, that when they united to disenfranchise the Black laborer they had cut the voting power of the laboring class in two. White labor in the populist movement…tried to realign economic warfare in the South and bring workers of all colors into united opposition to the employer. But they found that the power which they had put in the hands of the employers in 1876 so dominated political life that free and honest expression of public will at the ballot-box was impossible in the South, even for white men. They realized it was not simply the Negro who had been disenfranchised…it was the white laborer as well. The South had since become one of the greatest centers for labor exploitation in the world" [53]. -W.E.B. Du Bois, Black Reconstruction in America</p>
        <p>While Reconstruction was destroyed in the service of the ruling classes, its defeat could not have taken place without the acquiescence and assistance of the popular classes among the white population as well. In the South, in particular, the role of the "upcountry small farmer" was essential.</p>
        <p>During the war, these yeomen farmers had coined the phrase "rich man's war, poor man's ﬁght." At ﬁrst, there was some fear, and some electoral evidence, that poor whites and the newly freed slaves might make an alliance of sorts. Instead, the rift between them widened. The hierarchy constructed of white supremacy relied on inculcating racial superiority in many ways, one of them being the idea of "independence" that made white small farmers "superior" to slaves. They were poor, but at least they were masters of their own patch of land.</p>
        <p>The coming of the railroad changed all of this drastically. The railroad opened up the upcountry to the world economy. While it initially seemed like an opportunity, it was, in fact, a curse. Many small farmers dove into cotton production, the one thing ﬁnanciers were eager to fund. They quickly found, however, that the cost of transporting and marketing their goods, in addition to the costs of inputs from</p>
        <p>merchants, made success very difficult, and made it almost certain they would have to resort to credit. The rates of usury were, however, allowed to go high enough that a majority of these small farmers became trapped in webs of debt.</p>
        <p>The only way to keep going was to oﬀer one's crop as security for loans, ahead of time—the so-called "crop-lien." From masters of their own realm, these farmers had now become slaves to debt, losing all real control of their destiny and farming to avoid eviction rather than to make any money.</p>
        <p>This reality increased resentment at Reconstruction governments, and, given their dire ﬁnancial situation, created another base of support for those trying to make an issue out of higher taxes. This ultimately helped solidify white opposition to Republican rule behind the planters and their Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>As the 1870s turned into the 1880s, this consensus started to crack. The depression unleashed in the Panic of 1873 led to a breakdown of the two-party system as the two parties consolidated their views on how to move the country forward at the expense of workers and farmers. A variety of movements started to emerge, particularly strong in the West, opposing various aspects of the new consensus.</p>
        <p>In the 1880s, the movement started to strengthen itself through a series of "Farmers Alliances" that spread like wildﬁre across the country. The alliances not only advocated and agitated for things like railroad regulation and more equitable farming arrangements, but also organized their own cooperatives and attempts to break free of the unjust state of aﬀairs to which they were subject. The alliances were also major sites of political education where newspapers and meetings helped deﬁne and disseminate the economic realities of capitalism and exactly why these farmers were facing so much exploitation.</p>
        <p>A Black alliance, the Colored Farmers Alliance, also grew rapidly, ultimately embracing millions of Black farmers. Black farmers, likewise, were getting the short-end of the stick in terms of the results of Reconstruction-era land policies. Despite being shut out of land ownership, Black farmers were highly resistant to returning to the plantations as farm laborers. This led to a rise in tenancy where Black farmers rented the land and took on the production of the crops for a share of the crop that they could sell, or what is called "sharecropping."</p>
        <p>Similar to white farmers in the upcountry, however, this system turned viciously against them. The costs of credit to carry out various farming activities or to cover the cost of goods in the oﬀseason meant that they too, quickly and easily became ensnared by debt. This started to create intriguing political opportunities in the South. Disaﬀected white farmers started to become interested in the third-party movements representing popular discontent, particularly the Greenback-Labor Party.</p>
        <p>The Greenbackers embraced much of the agrarian reform ideas favored by farmers, and added in support for an income tax, the free ballot, and the eight-hour day for workers. In Mississippi, Texas, and Alabama, the Greenback movement found some shallow roots with white farmers who, recognizing the political situation, understood their only possible ally could be Blacks.</p>
        <p>Black politics, while in retreat, had not disappeared. The Colored Farmers Alliance was rooted in the same networks of religion, fraternal organization, and grassroots Republican political mobilization that</p>
        <p>had formed during Reconstruction. It was thus more politically inclined than the Southern Farmers Alliance of whites, which remained tied to the Democratic Party and its white supremacist policies.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, a growing number of Blacks seeking political opportunity sought to embrace the Greenback movement through a process known as "fusion." This meant Republicans running joint candidates or slates with third parties in order to maximize their voting power and take down the Democrats. This led to somewhat of a "second act" of Reconstruction. The Colored Farmers Alliance played a key role in the early 1890s in pushing the alliances to launch the Populist Party, turning the incipient potential of the Greenback Party into a serious political insurgency, but one which couldn't be truly national without a Southern component. Populism united the agrarian unrest of the West and South against the "money power" of the Wall Street banks.</p>
        <p>Populists championed public ownership of the largest corporations of the time—the railroads—as well as the communications apparatus of the country. In addition, they advocated an agricultural plan known as the "sub-treasury system" to replace the big banks in providing credit to the farmers as well as empowering cooperatives rather than private corporations to store and market goods. All of these were ingredients to break small farmers out of a cycle of debt.</p>
        <p>They also advocated for a shorter working day and a graduated income tax and sought to link together the demands of urban workers and those living in rural areas, saying in their preamble: "Wealth belongs to him who creates it, and every dollar taken from industry without an equivalent is robbery. "If any will not work, neither shall he eat." The interests of rural and civil labor are the same; their enemies are identical" [54]. This turned the People's Party into a real challenge to the ruling class on a national scale, one particularly potent in Georgia, North Carolina, and Alabama on the Southern front:</p>
        <p>"The People's (Populist) Party presidential candidate James B. Weaver received over one million votes in 1892 (approximately nine percent of the vote), winning 22 electoral votes (albeit, mostly in the West); in North Carolina, a Populist-Republican alliance took over the state legislature in 1894; Populists and their allies sat in Congress, governor's offices, and held dozens of local offices over the next two years; and scores of Black and white People's Party chapters had been established across the region" [55].</p>
        <p>This success would evoke a wave of terrorist violence against Populists and the Black community writ large that rivaled Reconstruction times and that, in terms of outright election fraud, exceeded it, which can be viewed clearly through the example of North Carolina, and Wilmington, in particular.</p>
        <p>The 1892 election, the ﬁrst time out for the Populists, opened up a new lane of cooperation. White Populists openly appealed for Black votes. "In addition to voting the ticket, blacks sometimes…took roles in county organizations and in mobilizing black voters. Some counties [even] placed blacks on ballots, and blacks were present at Populist rallies and in local Populist nominating conventions" [56]. In Raleigh, Blacks campaigned on horseback and on mule with the Presidential candidate James Weaver as well [57]. The results reﬂected the campaign: "African Americans voted "en masse" for the People's Party in 1892 in the ﬁrst and second districts of the eastern part of the state, where the majority of black counties were. Black voters in both Hyde and Wilson counties, for instance, gave near unanimous support to the third party ticket" [58].</p>
        <p>Over the next two years Populists, Black and white, worked with Republicans, Black and white, to hammer out a fusion agreement for the 1894 state elections. This was despite fairly signiﬁcant diﬀerences, such as the rise of Black populism, for instance, which heralded a rise in class diﬀerences within the Black community. Nonetheless, they found common ground and swept the elections:</p>
        <p>"Among other changes, the elected Republican-Populist majority revised and simpliﬁed election laws, making it easier for African Americans to vote; they restored the popular election of state and county officials, dismantling the appointive system used by Democrats to keep black candidates out of office; and the fusion coalition also reversed discriminatory "stock laws" (that required fencing oﬀ land) that made it harder for small farmers to compete against large landowners. The reform of election and county government laws, in particular, undermined planter authority and limited their control of the predominantly black eastern counties" [59].</p>
        <p>The Fusion coalition also championed issues like "public funding for education, legislation banning the convict-lease system, the criminalization of lynching" [60]. The Fusion government also restricted interest rates to address the massive debts being incurred by farmers and sharecroppers. Most notably, the Fusion governments stood up to the powerful railroad interests and their Northern backers like JP Morgan.</p>
        <p>The port city of Wilmington was an important Republican stronghold and had to be neutralized for Democrats to break through the Fusion hold on the state. In 1897, Democrats started a vicious campaign of white supremacy, forming clubs and militias that would become known as "Red Shirts," along with a media oﬀensive.</p>
        <p>As the Charlotte Observer would later state, it was the "bank men, the mill men, and businessmen in general," who were behind this campaign [61]. One major theme of the campaign was a particular focus on Black men supposedly "preying" on white women and girls. Physical violence and armed intimidation were used to discourage Blacks or Republicans and Populists of any color from voting.</p>
        <p>As the election drew closer, Democrats made tens of thousands of copies of an editorial by Alex Manley, the Black editor of the Daily Record newspaper. Manley, an important civic leader in Wilmington had written the editorial in response to calls for increased lynchings against Blacks to stop interracial relationships. Manley argued that white women who sought out relations with Black men often used rape allegations to cover their tracks or end a dalliance.</p>
        <p>While undoubtedly true, it raised the ire of white supremacists to the highest of pitches. On election day, most Blacks and Republicans chose not to vote as Red Shirt mobs were roaming the streets and had established checkpoints all over the city. Unsurprisingly, the Democrats won.</p>       
        <p>Unwilling to wait until their term of office began, some of the newly elected white officials and businesspeople decided to mount a coup and force out Black lawmakers right then and there. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of whites, marauded through the streets, attacking Black businesses and property and killing more than 300 Black people in the process. They forced the Republican mayor,</p>
        <p>along with all city commissioners, to resign at gunpoint. They banished them from the city, leading them in front of a mob that assaulted them before putting them on a train out of town. At least 2,000 Black residents ﬂed, leaving most of what they owned behind.</p>
        <p>The Wilmington massacre destroyed the Fusion coalition. All over the state, fraud and violence had been used against the Fusionists to no avail, but, as evidenced by the example of Wilmington, there was little chance of rebuilding ties of solidarity.</p>
        <p>The same can be said for the populist period more generally. While Populists certainly have a mixed record, at best, when it came to racism in the general sense, it's undeniable that the Populist upsurge opened up new political space for Blacks that had been shut-oﬀ by the two major parties. Further, it did so in a manner that was ideological much more commensurate with the unrealized desires of Republican rule.</p>
        <p>So, in North Carolina and all across the South, Populists were crushed in an orgy of violence and fraud. Racism was a powerful motivating factor in Southern politics across this entire period. This racism, however, did not stop large numbers of whites from entering into a political alliance with Blacks. The anti-Populist violence has to be seen in this context as a counterweight against the pull of self-interest in the economic ﬁeld.</p>      </section>
      <section id="a3s2">
        <h2>TOWARD A THIRD RECONSTRUCTION</h2>
        <p>Reconstruction looms large in our current landscape because so much of its promise remains unrealized. The Second Reconstruction, better known as "the sixties," took the country some of the way there, particularly concerning civil equality. It reaffirmed an agenda of placing social claims on capital. It also, however, revealed the limits of the capitalist system, showing how easily the most basic reforms can be rolled back. This was a lesson also taught by the ﬁrst Reconstruction.</p>
        <p>The history of Reconstruction also helps us to understand the centrality of Black Liberation to social revolution. The dispossession of Blacks from social and civic life was not just ideologically but politically foundational to capitalism in the U.S. The Solid South, dependent on racism, has played and continues to play a crucial role as a conservative inﬂuence bloc in favor of capital.</p>
        <p>Reconstruction also gives us insight into the related issue of why Black political mobilization, even in fairly mundane forms, is met with such hostility. The very nature of Black oppression has created what is essentially a proletarian nation which denounces racism not in the abstract, but in relation to its actual eﬀects. Unsurprisingly, then, Black Liberation politics has always brought forward a broad social vision to correct policies, not attitudes, which is precisely the danger since these policies are not incidental, but intrinsic, to capitalism.</p>
        <p>In sum, Reconstruction points us towards an understanding that "freedom" and "liberation" are bound up with addressing the limitations that proﬁt over people puts on any deﬁnition of those concepts. It helps us understand the central role of "white solidarity" in promoting capitalist class power. Neither racism nor capitalism can be overcome without a revolutionary struggle that presents a socialist framework.</p>

      <h1>Workers run the city: The Seattle General Strike</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">July 17, 2019</div>
      <div class="author">Ken Hammond</div>
      <hr>
      <p>To justify their rule, capitalists and their politicians tell us that we need them to organize society for us. They tell us that our suﬀering is not their doing, but the doing of other workers and oppressed people in the US and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>From February 6-11, 1919, the workers of Seattle, Washington, staged a general strike that disproved these two foundational lies of capitalism. The strike demands ranged from better pay and working conditions to solidarity with the workers of Russia and opposition to US military intervention in the
      anti-Soviet civil war taking place there. Workers not only struck against the factories, shipyards, docks, and logging operations, but also undertook the direct management of civil aﬀairs in the city, operating food banks and soup kitchens, providing childcare and other social services. The workers' movement made strides in overcoming racist and nationalist divisions as they worked toward multinational and international unity. Although it took place 100 years ago, it still provides inspiration and fuel to our struggle today.</p>
      <p>The Seattle General Strike was the result of a complex history of local economic development and political conﬂict, major organizing eﬀorts by labor unions, and the particular historical conjuncture of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the eﬀects of American global expansionism on the situation of workers and labor unions on the US West Coast.</p>
      <section id="a4s1">
        <h2>THE SHARPENING CLASS STRUGGLE IN SEATTLE</h2>
        <p>Seattle was a young city in the second decade of the 20th century. The area was the traditional home of the Duwamish and Suquamish peoples, who lived on and with the rich resources of the sea and the forests. Anglo "settlers" began to lay claim to land along Puget Sound in the 1850s, and the city of Seattle was formally established in 1869. Indigenous peoples were marginalized, dispossessed, displaced, and subordinated to American governmental authority through treaties and expropriations.</p>
        <p>The timber industry soon became a major force in the local economy, and timber barons came to play powerful roles in local political life. The Yukon gold rush of the 1890s also drove local development, as</p>
        <p>Seattle became the port of departure for thousands of prospectors seeking their fortunes in the streams and mountains of Alaska and the Canadian Northwest. Shipbuilding grew on a large scale, and Seattle's role as a Paciﬁc port expanded with the arrival of the railroad and the increasing volume of trade between the US and Asia. Shipping time to China or Japan was several days shorter from Seattle than it was from San Francisco or Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>As the number of workers in Seattle swelled, with working conditions harsh and wages low, labor organizing became critical to the future of the local masses. Trade unions, many affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), gained large local memberships. Union locals were coordinated through the Seattle Central Labor Council (SCLC). The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), also known as the Wobblies, had a large following in the Paciﬁc Northwest, with their radical program of syndicalism and political agitation. The IWW national newspaper was published in and distributed from Seattle. The Socialist Party, led by Eugene V. Debs, had several thousand members in the area, and although it did not succeed in electing local officials, it helped shape the militancy of local workers and their support for workers' control of industry.</p>
        <p>In 1914 the Panama Canal opened, and this quickly increased the shipping of goods from West Coast ports, both through the canal to the east and across the Paciﬁc. By the summer of 1916 the increasing pace of work and the demands of bosses for greater productivity without rises in wages triggered a longshoremen's strike, which lasted from June 1 to October 4 of that year. The National Guard was mobilized to help break the strike, and in some ports such as San Francisco the struggle ended in the late summer. But strikers in Seattle and Tacoma held out until early October, demonstrating their high level of militancy. The strike was ultimately settled without meeting the workers' demands, which increased their anger and frustration and set the stage for the next rounds of class struggle in the region.</p>
        <p>Just north of Seattle, workers in the city of Everett were on strike in the Fall of 1916 as well. On November 5 the Verona steamship set out from Seattle with 250 IWW militants to provide support for the Everett strikers. When the ship arrived, a mob of gun-wielding vigilantes and local lawmen attacked it.</p>
        <p>Five workers were killed and many more were wounded. Two so-called "deputies" were also killed, though the shots which felled them came not from the Verona but from somewhere onshore. Afterwards, 74 workers were charged with murder, which outraged local communities. The trial became a political struggle, and local juries acquitted all accused in the Spring of 1917. This victory fueled further militancy, inspiring a major strike in the logging camps, with the leadership of the IWW. In March 1918 the loggers won their demands, including an 8-hour day and improvements in working conditions. The tide of class struggle was on the rise.</p>

        <h2>THE SHARPENING OF THE INTERNATIONAL CLASS STRUGGLE</h2>
        <p>The political situation in Seattle was shaped not only by local conditions, but also by developments on a national and global scale. The United States joined in the imperialist conﬂict of World War I in April 1917. The Socialist Party, the IWW, and many workers opposed US involvement. The US government, in response, persecuted and prosecuted anti-war workers and organizers. The Bolshevik Revolution broke out in November 1917, and this gave rise to a "red scare" on the part of the American ruling class, which further tried to suppress the internationalism of unions and workers.</p>
        <p>The end of the war in Europe freed up American forces to be deployed to the Russian Far East, to be used along with Japanese troops to intervene in Russia in support of the reactionary "white" military trying to overthrow Soviet power and restore the rule of capitalism. Because of its proximity to Asia, Seattle was the logical port to use to ship men and materials to Vladivostok. By the Winter of 1918-19 the stage was set for a radical confrontation.</p>
        <p>Just a year before this, an unusual moment of international solidarity had taken place in Seattle, which contributed a real sense of class consciousness and of personal connections to these large global issues. A Soviet freighter, the Shilka, had put in to Elliott Bay, the entry to Seattle's harbor. The ship carried cargo of beans and peas, and when it entered port for refueling, workers in Seattle and from Russia met face to face, exchanging experiences and viewpoints. They held celebrations and held a mass meeting in the IWW hall, with a Soviet sailor as the guest of honor. The visit of the Shilka left a lasting sense of connection between the workers on both sides of the Paciﬁc, which would play its part in launching the General Strike.</p>

        <h2>WORKERS STOP "WORK," BUT RUN THE CITY</h2>
        <p>The General Strike evolved out of a work stoppage by 35,000 shipyard workers, which began on January 21, 1919. They appealed to the Central Labor Council for support, a General Strike committee was formed, and a call was issued for the strike to begin on February 6. When that day came, over 100,000 workers joined the strike. The demands included better pay and conditions, but also opposition to the loading and shipping of war materials to ﬁght the Soviets. Not only dock workers and shipyard workers, but also loggers and workers from the city's trades joined in.</p>
        <p>For the next week the strikers essentially ran the city. They set up food services and child care, patrolled the streets to maintain order, kept supplies going to hospitals, and carried out political education programs. The Seattle General Strike was a laboratory in which the working class gained important experience in organizing and managing social aﬀairs. It was also a struggle that pushed the struggle for multinational class unity forward. While the IWW and the International Longshoremen's Association were open to workers of all nationalities, most trade unions in Seattle at the time excluded Japanese and Black workers. Yet when the general strike erupted, both groups of workers joined the ranks of strikers, with Japanese labor associations formally endorsing the strike actions.</p>
        <p>Of course, the local and national bourgeoisie could not tolerate this kind of workers' movement. Municipal, state, and federal authorities all mobilized to attack the strikers. The city government recruited "Special constables"-armed thugs deployed to intimidate the workers. The federal government sent in troops as well. Even the national leadership of the American Federation of Labor failed to support the strikers, as they feared the radicalism of the workers in the context of the repression of the red scare. Big media, in those days the national newspapers, acted as the voice of corporate interests and slandered the strikers as "traitors" and "Bolsheviks." The General Strike Committee had to yield to massive physical and political pressure, and by February 11 the strike was called oﬀ.</p>
        <p>The Seattle General Strike of 1919 did not establish worker power on an ongoing basis. The forces arrayed against the working class at that time were too strong to be overcome in one city or region. The power of American capitalism was still on the rise as the era of European imperialism was beginning to wane. That year also saw worker uprisings in Berlin, Vienna, and Budapest, and large scale strike actions in Scotland and Italy. The legacy of these struggles lives on, and in the present age of the decline of American and global capitalism it can serve to inspire socialists and working-class militants across America and around the world.</p>
