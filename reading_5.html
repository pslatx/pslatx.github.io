      <p><i>Excerpted / Edited for the Candidacy Class Series of 2023</i></p>
      <p><i>This document aims to ﬁll out and give more detail to our strategy in relation to mass organizing and intervention in spontaneous struggles. In my view, it generally reﬂects the long-standing conceptions of the leadership of the Party from the time of its founding — the underlying assumptions of how we orient to mass work, and the various national interventions aimed at building class consciousness among the working class. But until now, much of this has been communicated verbally and not been written out. The statistics and reference points are all from 2019, before the 2020 uprisings.</i></p>
      <p>The main function of a communist political party is to create a force capable of leading the working class to political power. Everything it does should be judged with that objective in mind.</p>
      <p>The communist party distinguishes itself from all other political formations in two main respects: 1) its membership is by necessity limited to that <b>minority</b> of the working class that is the most self-sacriﬁcing and dedicated to carrying out the class struggle until victory; and 2) it does not represent the interest of any one segment of the working class, but rather the long-term interests of the entire class — which ultimately can only be realized in the conquest of power and the end of class society itself. The party itself is a living synthesis of the accumulated lessons of prior generations of struggle.</p>
      <p>There is an inescapable tension here: to overthrow capitalism, with all its centralism and sophistication and repressive force, one needs a tightly organized party that is a minority (an advanced guard or "vanguard"), as well as the active participation and militancy of a much larger number, and at least the acceptance of a <b>majority</b> of the working class.</p>
      <p>History has shown repeatedly that a tightly organized minority with revolutionary consciousness is insufficient to take and hold power if it does not have inﬂuence and sufficient backing of this scale. On the ﬂip side, history has also shown that a party with mass support but no tightly organized mechanism to seize power in a time of crisis will also be unable to rise to the challenge.</p>
      <p>So the party develops its general line — its outlook, tactics and organizational methods so as to accomplish both these twin tasks at once: to build a tightly organized <b>minority</b> of the leaders of the working class in the form of the party, while also training its cadres with a mass orientation and inside of various mass organizations and movements to gain inﬂuence among and lead <b>far greater numbers</b>.</p>
      <p>Lenin wrote famously of this tension in Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder, "As long as it was a question of winning the proletariat's vanguard over to the side of communism, priority went and still goes to propaganda work; even propaganda circles, with all their parochial limitations, are useful under these conditions, and produce good results. But when it is a question of practical action by the masses, of the disposition, if one may so put it, of vast armies, of the alignment of all the class forces in a given society for the ﬁnal and decisive battle, then propagandist methods alone, the mere repetition of the truths of "pure" communism, are of no avail. In these circumstances, one must not count in thousands, like the propagandist belonging to a small group that has not yet given leadership to the masses; in these circumstances one must count in millions and tens of millions. In these circumstances, we must ask ourselves, not only whether we have convinced the vanguard of the revolutionary class, but also whether the historically eﬀective forces of all classes …"</p>
      <p>We are not building a sect that is apart from the working class, but rather an advanced detachment of the working class, which can draw together its existing leaders (formal and informal) on the basis of a socialist program. To build an organization that is inaccessible to the larger working class, that speaks a diﬀerent language from it, looks down upon it, or is cynical about its ability to unite and ultimately make a revolution, would all reﬂect sectarianism. On the ﬂip side, some parties have fallen to the error of opportunism, compromising the long-term interests of the working class for short-term gain among the masses." This usually takes the form of adapting to the viewpoint of a particular sector of workers so as to retain unity with it; this can also be considered "tailism," tailing the masses instead of trying to lead them.</p>
      <p>We have avoided these errors by always focusing our organization on the dynamic and active points of class struggle in all its forms. That means building new sites of struggle where opportunities arise, joining with existing movements and sites of mass struggle where people are already in motion, and by consistently pivoting as necessary in our agitation and propaganda to speak to those immersed in struggle. This has put us in direct opposition at every moment to the capitalist-imperialist ruling class.</p>
      <p>At the site of struggle, no matter how small or big, is where the existing leaders of the working class, and those most open to revolutionary ideas, will be found. This is where we identify and recruit new leaders, where we develop ourselves as leaders, where we demonstrate the particular leadership role of the party and its members, and where we learn new lessons.</p>
      <p>Because the Party is always looking to expand and widen the struggle, to bring in more and more of the working class and demonstrate its power, we have a distinct manner of presenting in our mass organizing. We train ourselves and each other to speak "as leaders of the country." This means learning to speak, write, agitate and converse persuasively about the struggle to all diﬀerent types of people, with diﬀerent backgrounds and life experiences. It means developing talking points, literature, slogans and demands, a manner of presenting that has the ability to move those already in the struggle, but also win over the majority of the working class to that struggle. This is what we mean by "mass orientation" — not about concealing or obscuring the socialist program, but to always be oriented (or pointed) towards expanding the struggle and winning over other sectors.</p>     
      <p>Other types of activists try to keep a particular struggle narrowly deﬁned, or they speak in such a way to only appeal to the already converted, or to build clout or inﬂuence among a particular in-crowd. Their goal is not working-class unity and revolution.</p>

        <h2>THE NUMBERS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR REVOLUTION</h2>
        <p>Let's pose the question of what is the real scale of the "majority of the working class." This is not a simple arithmetic question but a political one. What would it take to make a revolution in the United States, a largely urbanized but vast country of 327 million people? It would likely require the concerted and sustained activity of 10-15% of the population; this number is somewhat arbitrary but it approximates the study of active participants in previous social revolutions. That means a revolutionary mass consisting of maybe 20 to 30 million people (excluding small children).</p>
        <p>This scale is perhaps on the high end but consider the numbers necessary for the working class to take and hold power in just the country's major metropolitan centers. In the United States there are 106 metropolitan areas with 500,000 or more people; cumulatively these 106 areas make up 222 million people, over two-thirds of the country. Another 45 million people live in 250 metropolitan areas of 100,000 to 500,000 people. Taken together, over 80 percent of the U.S. population lives in urban / suburban areas, spread out in these 356 metropolitan areas. (This compares to Russia in 1917, where over 80 percent of the country lived in non-urban areas and there were fewer than 20 cities with over 100,000 people. There, the revolution could be initiated in a few major cities, but it could only be held because of the high state of struggle and tumult among the peasantry, which prevented the counter-revolution from immediately invading the cities and crushing the revolution.)</p>
        <p>Victorious revolutions have all taken place in contexts where the old ruling class is in a state of crisis and paralysis, when its form of rule appears broadly as illegitimate. Such a period does not last forever, before the bourgeois ruling class regroups. How can 10-15% of the U.S. population truly hold power? In the United States one could expect a sizable counter-revolutionary mass, organized by the bourgeoisie, involving the upper sections of the petit-bourgeoisie, the fascistic elements in the petit-bourgeoisie and working class, and including big parts of the vast machinery of the state. Without exaggeration, in the United States this counter-revolutionary mass too could number in the tens of millions if so organized.</p>
        <p>In addition to these tens of millions of people directly engaged in revolutionary and counter-revolutionary struggle, there would stand between them a far larger number, who are generally politically passive. The ﬁght for the hearts and minds of these middle strata would be pivotal in a revolutionary crisis. Among the approximately 150 million or so remaining adults, tens of millions more would need to be won over to sympathize with the revolution, to help carry out its policies, and to serve as a buﬀer against counter-revolution. One would have to count on the neutrality or at least passive acceptance of tens of millions more people, who would wait to see what the socialists could really deliver and would not immediately go into the camp of counter-revolution.</p>
        <p>Any combination of events can create a revolutionary crisis — a disastrous imperialist war leading to widespread mutiny, a prolonged economic crisis, a military struggle for power within the bourgeoisie itself, government neglect in the event of mass natural disasters, wildly excessive use of force in suppressing peaceful demonstrations, etc. It is of course impossible to map out in advance the precise numbers, or the exact ﬂow, of a revolutionary process in the United States.</p>
        <p>But the point here is to establish the <b>scale</b> of the mass revolutionary movement that would be needed in the United States. It is necessary for an organization that aspires to revolution, no matter its size at a given moment, to think about the essential social forces to bring it about; without such an orientation, the word "revolutionary" is basically an empty slogan or self-description.</p>
        <p>Establishing this scale does not answer what to do or what to say in the here and now, what united fronts to form and what tactics to execute. It does not mean small-scale struggles are without value — not at all, as the Lenin quote above shows, especially if they help recruit mass leaders or gain experiences that set the stage for the Party to gain wider inﬂuence. Rather this discussion of scale emphasizes what sort of genuinely mass orientation and temperament is needed for our Party and our members as we do all of our organizing. Even if our organizing starts in particular small niches or substrata of people, we cannot be content with niche organizing. It helps us think seriously about what sectors and communities must be mobilized to get to this sort of scale, and then to evaluate in that light our tactics, conduct and rhetoric, as well as our ability to pivot and show initiative.</p>
        <p>These tens of millions of people — revolutionaries and active supporters — will not fall from the sky or magically appear out of thin air. They must come from the existing population, which means from the towns and neighborhoods, schools and workplaces where we currently are, all around us, and many places where the Party is currently not active. And they will not become revolutionaries as fully-formed and perfect human beings with spotless records. To the contrary, they will be moved into practical action despite their current and past contradictions, and despite the ongoing inﬂuence of bourgeois ideology over their minds. They will certainly not all be PSL members. But if we are serious about revolution in the United States, we have to recognize the mass of real-life human beings who must be organized and counted on. The real danger of sectarianism in this stage of rebuilding socialism is not about how we conduct ourselves with other socialist groups but instead sectarianism in relation to the working class itself.

        <h2>RACIAL-NATIONAL MAKEUP OF THE COUNTRY</h2>
        <p>Let's look even closer at these numbers, to better grasp the scope both the challenge and opportunities in front of us. Of the country's 354 metropolitan centers, 50 are so-called "majority minority" — that is a majority are of oppressed nationalities. In another 75 of these metropolitan centers, racially and nationally oppressed people constitute one-third to one-half of the population, with white people constituting the majority. In the remaining 227 metropolitan centers, white people make up over two-thirds of the population. The latter are generally smaller metropolitan areas, but collectively they hold considerable territory and social weight — especially in those states where the population is more dispersed.</p>
        <p>From the standpoint of both historical review and forward-looking strategy, it is essential to recognize that the oppressed nationalities will provide the backbone of revolutionary leadership and energy in the United States. The rising of the Black community in particular has been the engine for the main social convulsions of the last 200 years. Black social movements at their peak involved the concerted and sustained activity of 20 percent of the Black community.</p>
        <p>In a country like Jamaica, Haiti, or South Africa, the sustained uprising of the Black masses was sufficient to overthrow governments, with almost no white support domestically or only small groups of whites. In the United States, it is not so; with 12% of the population, the strategic alliance between the Black movement and the progressive sections of white people and other oppressed people has always been necessary to overturn oppressive conditions and laws, and will be necessary to make a revolution.</p>
        <p>The Black nation is concentrated in metropolitan centers across the North, Midwest and West Coast, while constituting a larger geographic majority or near-majority in the Black Belt section of the Deep South, which stretches through seven states. In this same region and surrounding areas, however, the forces of racist reaction are also strongest and most deeply rooted among white workers, and there is the greatest militarization of working-class culture. The conditions for white and Black workers in this region are on the whole the worst in the country. Signiﬁcant cracks in the reactionary "Solid South," and the formation of strong multinational movements there with Black leadership, have and will continue to reverberate nationally in a powerful way.</p>
        <p>Latinos, who now constitute the largest "minority," are overwhelmingly working class as well, although of course this varies widely based on what country people are from. There are long-standing communities of oppressed Mexicanos/Chicanos in the Southwest and California with many generations of resistance and struggle. There are likewise large established Puerto Rican communities in the Southeast and Northeast (from big cities to smaller metropolitan areas) and in Chicago, connected closely with the colonial status of the island. Then there are millions more who have migrated here in the last 30 years from Mexico and Central America, ﬁltering largely into the construction, restaurant, agricultural and domestic labor markets of many states, including where Latino communities have historically been quite small. Many of these immigrant workers have been, once organized, the most combative and resilient sectors of the working class despite the additional vulnerabilities they face because of status. This is because of a high sense of unity and a shared experience of struggle among immigrant workers, and many draw strength from traditions of resistance in their own countries. Then there is also a considerable counter-revolutionary population from the petit-bourgeois and bourgeois of Latin America, many of whom say they have "ﬂed" left-wing governments in their home countries; this petit-bourgeois and bourgeois sector consistently gives misleadership to the "Latino community" in politics, in academia and in the media.</p>
        <p>Native peoples constitute 3 to 5 million people — between 1 and 2 percent of the overall population. But the genocidal destruction of Native peoples will never be completed. In ﬁve states (Alaska, South Dakota, New Mexico, Montana and Oklahoma) 10% or more of all births last year were to Native women. The Navajo Nation is, by land mass, larger than 10 U.S. states; its population of 350,000 is more than half the size of the least populated U.S. state (Wyoming). A majority of Native people now live in cities, not reservations, with Los Angeles home to more Native people than any other locality in the country. Despite the demographic reality, the Native struggle, ongoing for centuries, continues to provide a wellspring of resistance, and especially across the West and Great Plains states. The Native struggle, in practically every form, draws attention to the colonial foundation of the country and the illegitimacy of bourgeois rule.</p>
        <p>The Asian/Paciﬁc Islander communities now comprise over 6% of the U.S. population, more than 22 million people, from more than 23 countries, and are the fastest growing part of the U.S. population. More than a million live in New York, half a million in Los Angeles, and hundreds of thousands in many other large cities. In dozens of small and medium-sized cities, particularly in the West, Asian/Paciﬁc Islanders in fact constitute the majority. While Chinese, Filipino and Japanese Americans have long roots in the United States, dating back to the 19th century, millions of Asian/Paciﬁc Islanders are relatively recent immigrants, work in low-pay occupations and live in poverty or near-poverty.</p>
        <p>The composition of the U.S. working class continues to change via refugee and migration ﬂows as well. This is a worldwide phenomenon with 60 million people on the move worldwide on account of destabilizing wars, economic dislocation, climate change and other factors, facilitated by technological improvements in communications and transportation. The refugee and migrant issue has become a dominant and persistent factor in many country's political struggles, and will remain so. Migrants naturally ﬂee in the direction of the value that has been transferred from their homelands to the imperialist countries. This has important strategic implications for internationalizing the struggle inside the United States, and fusing the anti-imperialist struggles with the U.S. class struggles.</p>

        <h2>THE POOR AND WORKING CLASS: PATH TO UNITY</h2>
        <p>We never know what issues or series of events will spark the greatest resistance and militancy, and what can awaken literally tens of millions of people and compel them to struggle. Even the best revolutionaries rarely anticipate such moments with clarity and are caught somewhat organizationally and politically unprepared for them. The mass struggles of the recent period conﬁrm this — the "Arab Spring", the Occupy movement, the Yellow Vests in France, the Puerto Rican struggle against the corrupt governor, etc. In each case, it was not really the issue that mattered most; the issue was the spark and quickly all the rest of society's ﬂammable material entered the ﬁre.</p>
        <p>What matters more than the particular front of struggle we focus on (housing, jobs, climate change, police brutality, etc.) is our orientation, preparedness and pre-existing connections with the people who we anticipate could potentially rise up. Where would the 25 million revolutionary actors and 50 million revolutionary sympathizers come from? What sectors are prone to rise up heroically, and what sectors can organize not for an instant but can develop the tenacity and temperament to withstand the struggle in all its phases? What is the programmatic basis for unity that can draw together the ﬁghting sections of the population across race and national background and across widely disparate geographies? Who are the existing leaders that masses of people look to? Where can the sort of broad collectivity and culture be produced to form a revolutionary subject in the United States with sufficient scale to win and hold power? All these questions have to be on our mind.</p>
        <p>Of course, the ﬁrst and fundamental answer is poor and working-class people. The number of wage and salary workers (of all incomes) is 150 million adults. Of those, 58 million work at hourly rates. 6 million people are unemployed. In addition to the 150 million salaries and wage workers, over 90 million working-age adults are not employed, or at least not on the books. That includes 14 million stay-at-home parents and caretakers, 48 million retirees, 16 million people who are ill or have disabilities, and 16 million students.</p>
        <p>The above ﬁgures on work are not synonymous with the Marxist understanding of social classes. Not every worker or non-worker, as deﬁned by government ﬁgures, is of the working class. A salaried employee, to them, could be a high-paid manager. As we know, there are many rich people who do no work at all. A rich student and a poor student are both technically "not in the workforce" according to government statistics, although they have antagonistic class interests.</p>
        <p>Income is also imprecise as a class category but is broadly quite instructive. What is sure is that 140 million people in the United States, 40 percent of the population, are currently in or near poverty. This is a staggering ﬁgure, brought out by the Poor People's Campaign, that all revolutionaries must absorb into our thinking and strategizing. Who are the 140 million poor people? They are split fairly evenly between men and women, white and non-white. Around 60% of Black, Latino and Native peoples are in or near poverty, compared to one-third of white people, but in absolute terms white people constitute the largest single group of poor people: 66 million. 40 million of the 140 million are children. 21 million are elderly.</p>
        <p>These 140 million constitute the lowest rungs on the economic ladder. It is the least organized part of the working class and of society — in neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces. For those formally under the federal government's ridiculous poverty line — those in public housing, on Medicaid, disability, etc — they have virtually no organization to ﬁght for their collective interests on a national scale, and thus they are entirely at the mercy of "friendly" politicians. The interests of 140 million can best be articulated with the program of turning all vital human needs — food, housing, clean water and air, education, health care, and a digniﬁed retirement — into guaranteed human rights. Regardless of race or geography, the interests of all 140 million are served by such a socialist program; in fact their only hope, as a class, is in such a reorganization of society.</p>
        <p>These 140 million also provide a picture for what is coming for tens of millions of others. This 140 million exists during a time of <b>LOW</b> unemployment when the stock market is booming. When the next recession hits, and as the technological processes of automation, robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence ramp up, more and more sectors of the workforce will be made precarious and will permanently join the ranks of the poor.</p>
        <p>In ﬁghting for the interests and the program of the 140 million now, we are ﬁghting for the interests of the whole working class. The socialist project — which ﬁnally resolves the fundamental contradiction between private property and socialized production — is most naturally rooted in the poor and dispossessed, but also would be a giant step forward for better oﬀ "middle" strata. Whatever economic "security" they may currently possess can be taken away quickly, and the social bribe oﬀered to this section of the working class has generally been withdrawn in any case under the pressures of austerity, automation and outsourcing. Socialist planning also is the only program that can reverse climate change, which will ultimately aﬀect all social classes (although not equally). The point is that the socialist program, while it is fundamentally rooted in the interests of the poor and working class, can also be appealing in other social strata, which also are drawn into antagonism with the existing system. Socialism in power could answer all the fundamental crises of capitalism: the drive towards catastrophic war, automation and job destruction, climate change, among others.</p>
        <p>To emphasize the mass of 140 million is not to diminish the importance of other workers either. There are many more workers who are not technically in or near poverty and some have recently been quite combative (unionized teachers, health care workers, software developers); their actions in the last few years have most clearly demonstrated to all of society the power of the working class, and thus have strategic importance for organizing other sections as well.</p>
        <p>Certain industries one can envision as strategically necessary for a revolution in the United States. Also necessary will be major splits in the armed forces. But this document is not attempting to draw out a general thesis on these questions; rather, again, to emphasize what we mean by moving the masses and having a mass approach, to be able to lead in many areas at once.</p>

      <section id="a1s4">
        <h2>HOW TO OVERCOME NATIONAL OPPRESSION SO AS TO UNITE THE CLASS?</h2>
        <p>To raise such a momentous ﬁgure of leading tens of millions of people poses the question of how they can be united. At present they are mostly disunited and disorganized — or even worse, united around reactionary programs and organized by diﬀerent sections of the bourgeoisie. Broad sections of the poor and working class think of their political interests as opposed to one another, and both the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as the corporate media, enforce these divisions and build their own power by keeping the working class divided on false bases.</p>
        <p>To break through this requires a shared class program, reﬂecting shared class interests, but it also must redress special forms of oppression, and this program must be weaved creatively and persistently into all struggles.</p>
        <p>Given the multiracial composition of this 140 million, the ﬁght against white supremacy and chauvinism must be primary to really talk of building unity. This cannot consist of empty phrases about not seeing color, but requires recognizing the particular struggles Black, Latino and Native people have faced in this country, and breaking in both word and deed from this legacy of white supremacy in the here and now.</p>
        <p>Some radicals think multinational unity is impossible and even undesirable. They are often more cynical about these possibilities than the masses themselves. From our organizing experiences, we have found that Black and Latino working-class communities generally welcome genuine manifestations of class unity and desire it on a wider scale. This is out of class instinct and also an understanding that the backwardness of white workers in particular has been the main social prop and source of stability for the white ruling class. So long as the white population of all classes remains politically united, it is difficult for any progressive struggle to advance. At the same time, there is an equally long history of white liberals, some trade unionists and even some "leftists" who might momentarily preach the gospel of unity in the abstract, but never recognize Black and Latino people as real equals, or sell out the struggles of the oppressed in favor of separate deals with the white power structure.</p>
        <p>The key factor in overcoming this historical and justiﬁable distrust is the development of authentic revolutionary Black and Latino leaders who can also lead and give voice to poor and working-class whites, and thus lead the whole class. It is highly unlikely — and for understandable reasons — that in 2019 a great mass of Black, Latino and Native poor and working people will follow in tow behind a progressive or leftist movement with all-white, or nearly all-white leadership and cadres. But many poor and working-class whites would accept, and in fact embrace, Black, Latino and Native leadership at this stage, provided such a leadership also speaks in class terms and thereby give voice and clarity to the shared struggles they are facing. Despite the media presentation, poor white people on average tend to be less reactionary than upper middle-class white people, and poor white people too often have a class instinct (although far less developed) for multiracial unity. This potentiality can only be realized through organization and the struggle itself — through politics. Wherever the left fails to organize poor and working-class whites, the racists and the bourgeoisie will retain their hegemonic rule over them.</p>
        <p>Black leadership of poor white people has always been the brightest "red line" that the ruling class cannot allow people to cross. The alliance of Black freedman with poor white farmers after the Civil War; the unemployed councils and industrial unions with genuine multiracial leadership in the 1930s; Dr. King's growing leadership of the anti-war and poor people's movements; Fred Hampton's Rainbow Coalition; these were all considered top risks to the U.S. political order because they threatened to unite a great mass of Black poor people with a considerable cross-section of aggrieved white people. What they see as a risk we must see as an opportunity.</p>
        <p>By "authentic Black, Latino and Native leaders", we do not mean individuals who are selected from largely white organizations based on the color of their skin — a recipe for tokenization. Rather, this means political leaders rooted in their own community's struggles, who are democratically elected to lead by other cadres based on their commitment, ability and experience.</p>
        <p>The Party can work towards these goals of building multinational unity 1) by orienting towards the ongoing struggles of the 140 million poor people of all backgrounds, as well as the struggles for democracy and against imperialist war, all of which can draw together broad unity; 2) by recruiting cadres of nationally oppressed backgrounds, training them in class politics and agitation, while continuing to develop their leadership in their communities; and 3) recruiting white cadres with the seriousness and humility to organically connect with poor people of all backgrounds, and who recognize the strategic necessity of Black, Latino and Native cadre development.</p>

        <h2>THE ROLE OF THE PARTY IN BUILDING CADRES, CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS AND CLASS UNITY</h2>
        <p>The above section provides an overview of the type of mass support needed for revolutionary strategy, laying out the basic numbers of the working class and particular communities of oppressed people in contradiction with the capitalist state. The role of the party is to be able to lead across many diﬀerent sectors, communities and struggles, to synthesize from the existing struggles <b>a general line of march in the interest of the whole working class</b>. This process is easy to declare on paper, but in practice it of course proceeds unevenly, with twists and curves, distortions, mistakes and contradictions.</p>
        <p>A key strategic goal in relation to mass organizing is to orient our program and demands to build class consciousness among the 140 million people who are in or near poverty, the base of the working class. As we go lower into the proletariat, the composition is more heavily composed of women, oppressed nationalities and LGBTQ people than the middle and upper classes. This fact shows the possibility for the working class elements to give leadership to all these struggles for genuine democracy and equality — against the petit bourgeois and bourgeois elements — and also for the specially oppressed to give leadership to the whole class.</p>
        <p>Many on the left are only consumed with the question of simply what is the "right line" in the abstract, because they do not have a mass audience on their mind, and they aren't thinking about moving millions of people to actually win. By contrast, the magnitude of this mission guides us at all times — when we discuss and debate politics, it is not for the mere sake of debate. That is what's on our mind when we consider how to organize our meetings, what to speak about, how to speak online, in our classrooms, workplaces, and so on. This guides us as we build structures and routines within the party itself. We want to recruit and train leaders, while raising class consciousness among many tens of millions;</p>
        <p>This means challenging ourselves too. The revolutionary party oﬀers camaraderie and acceptance to people of all backgrounds who come to ﬁght for a better world. But given that it is but a detachment and reﬂection of the working class itself, as well as individuals from other layers, it will never be fully exempt from the contradictions and divisions of society. Building a mass revolutionary socialist party based on the multinational working class, against all the tools and weapons of the bourgeoisie and petit-bourgeoisie within the belly of the U.S. Empire, is the hardest thing to do in the world.</p>
        <p>This requires enough openness to learn from those we are trying to draw in, enough patience to allow people to correct mistakes, and also enough ﬁrmness to combat those inﬂuences which if introduced into the party would make it impossible for us to endure as a group, or to ever reach the scale we need. It also requires us to embrace that our mission — to build a militant movement armed with revolutionary consciousness to overthrow the greatest Empire in world history — is by deﬁnition not a safe endeavor. It will be hard and carries with it risks.</p>
        <p>As revolutionaries, we each accept the responsibility of resolving the contradictions among the working class (who are divided ideologically and materially in 1,000 diﬀerent ways) in such a fashion as to strengthen their capacity and conﬁdence to ﬁght against a common foe. That common foe is a ruling class that is not only the most violent, brutal and abusive in history, but sophisticated and smart in preventing the consolidation of a broad working-class revolutionary political pole. They are experts in diverting the people's resistance to oppression into atomized pockets and niches, where they are more easily controlled, bought oﬀ and repressed.</p>
        <p>In the ﬁeld of mass organizing, there is no single front of struggle that best serves all our tasks. Insofar as the Party can elaborate a mass organizing strategy at this moment, the most important thing is 1) an orientation towards the interests of poor and working-class people; and 2) full-scale participation in all the spontaneous democratic and class struggles, at the point of struggle itself, wherever it breaks out or where we can help it break out.</p>
        <p>These two planks can in some moments be in tension with one another insofar as pre-existing working-class struggles and spontaneous struggles are disconnected from one another. That may pull us in diﬀerent directions in practical terms. The task of our members and leadership will be to ﬁgure out organizational methods to synchronize this work, to be able to spin on a dime as the struggle shifts. In our culture, which is so dominated now by social media and mainstream media, we have to recognize that the topics driving political discussion and consciousness often shift dynamically; the notion that "bread and butter" issues are all that's on people's minds is false.</p>
        <p>We believe the distinction made between the largely spontaneous "protest movement" and ongoing "base-building" is often exaggerated; these are only operating in diﬀerent categories because of the organizational weaknesses of the revolutionary left in the U.S. "Organizing" and "mobilizing" are not opposites; "mobilizing" is a mass organizing tactic, an intervention aimed at demonstrating collective power and raising class consciousness. Because the left has few cadres and resources, sometimes it feels forced to choose between these orientations. But it doesn't have to be so.</p>     
        <p>We have to be creative in how we thread these types of mass organizing together. So for instance — how do we intervene in a spontaneous struggle that may appear "unrelated" so that it links the spontaneous struggle together with the long-term interests of the working class and thus raises consciousness for all? On the ﬂip side, how does our organizing of poor and working-people take up the whole range of national and international political issues dominating the headlines, which allows us to draw people from this work into spontaneous protests. If we've done our organizing work well — rather than fall into the single-issue organizing conceptions of the NGOs — there should be no great problem to cancel a tenant meeting, for instance, to mobilize for an important protest against child detention or in defense of a targeted nation abroad.</p>
        <p>In bigger cities in particular we are generally outmatched in terms of resources and political inﬂuence by the NGOs. In smaller cities and in places outside the main political centers of the bourgeoisie, the ﬁeld of organizing may be more open. But there are openings everywhere. Every locality has working-class people who are completely unorganized, and in this political / social media moment all national and international political crises register immediately everywhere and can become the basis for local organizing. Even small all-white conservative towns of a few thousand people saw recent protests against family separation and child detention at the border (and therefore experienced more pitched confrontations than the protests in more liberal places).</p>
        <p>Multiple forms of organizing and agitation are necessary for us to continuously train ourselves as organizers and leaders, to be able to respond quickly and eﬀectively to times of crisis, and to reach the scale of a revolutionary process in the United States. Our top mission is to recruit into our ranks those ﬁghters and existing leaders who can take the Party for Socialism and Liberation to the next level, in anticipation of the current counter-revolutionary era of politics ﬁnally giving way to revolutionary possibilities.</p>
