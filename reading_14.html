        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Sexism is so endemic today that it can be difficult to imagine a society that does not degrade and devalue women. Modern capitalist society is a form of class society, and in today's capitalist society women face sexism everywhere we turn — within our own homes and personal relationships, in school and in our professional careers, even as we walk down the street.</p>
<p>But this is not the way things always have been and, despite its prevalence in today's society, the oppression of women is not a part of human nature. Sexism is not natural, which means we can eliminate it.</p>
<p>The oppression of women is rooted in a hierarchical system that values men over women, a system organized around patriarchal norms but that is much broader than patriarchy, in which the oppression of people is not based simply on sex but on class.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s2">
        <h2>CLASS SOCIETY THE ROOT OF WOMEN'S OPPRESSION</h2>
<p>For the vast majority of human history, society was organized around communal groups, and women were not specially oppressed. It was the emergence of class society that formed the foundation for patriarchal norms and the oppression of women.</p>
<p>Class society is the organization of society based on economic exploitation. People are separated into two classes with opposing interests: one is the group of people who own the means of production, who use this ownership of resources and productive forces to accumulate wealth unto themselves — the ruling class; the other class is the group of people who do not own the means of production, but who, through their labor, in fact produce the wealth of society — the laborers. The ruling class exploits the laboring class in order to amass wealth.</p>
<p>Feudalism and capitalism are two examples of class society. In a feudal society, serfs and peasants worked the land, but they did not own the land, and they did not keep the full value of what they produced. Much of the fruits of their labor were handed over to the lords, the landowners that were members of the ruling class that became rich off the land. In a capitalist society, workers produce goods and provide services, but they do not own factories and corporations. The capitalists who own the factories, banks and corporations, members of the ruling class, become rich by paying workers less than the value of the goods produced and lining their pockets with the difference — the proﬁts.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s3">
        <h2>COMMUNAL SOCIETY</h2>
<p>If we think of all of human history as one year, or 365 days, the duration of class society and patriarchy would be only ﬁve days — less than one week. For the vast majority of our existence, we lived in communal societies. In those societies, women and men performed different work, but all people were valued for their contributions to the survival of the group.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, humanity struggled together for survival in the face of scarcity and deprivation. There were no social classes based upon wealth or power, and no individuals or families amassed wealth; everything was owned by the communities as a whole. Each task was critical to survival and considered a communal responsibility. Hunting, gathering, building homes, child rearing and caring for elders — each of these tasks was valued as critical and was accomplished by members of the group working together rather than by individuals or individual familial units. An individual's value to society was not based on their gender but rather on their ability to contribute to each of these critical tasks, tasks which may have been performed by different genders but were held in high esteem regardless.</p>
<p>In "The Origins of the Family, Private Property and the State," Frederick Engels outlined the material reasons for why people lived communally:</p>
<p>A division of the tribe or of the gens into different classes was equally impossible. And that brings us to the examination of the economic basis of these conditions. The population is extremely sparse; it is dense only at the tribe's place of settlement, around which lie in a wide circle ﬁrst the hunting grounds and then the protective belt of neutral forest, which separates the tribe from others. The division of labor is purely primitive, between the sexes only. The man ﬁghts in the wars, goes hunting and ﬁshing, procures the raw materials of food and the tools necessary for doing so. The woman looks after the house and the preparation of food and clothing, cooks, weaves, sews. They are each master in their own sphere: the man in the forest, the woman in the house. Each is owner of the instruments which he or she makes and uses: the man of the weapons, the hunting and ﬁshing implements, the woman of the household gear. The housekeeping is communal among several and often many families. What is made and used in common is common property — the house, the garden, the long-boat.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s4">
        <h2>CLASS SOCIETY PRODUCES INEQUALITY</h2>
<p>As Engels explained, inequality emerged for the ﬁrst time only after millennia of this communal, shared existence. With the emergence of surplus, wealth, and class society came the emergence of patriarchal society and the oppression of women. Over time, as the development of the tools and methods of production produced a surplus, one sector of society, primarily men as the primary hunters and organizers of animal husbandry, could hoard and accumulate wealth as private property.¹ Before the advent of private property, there was no special power or privileges associated with this type of labor. As explained above, all types of labor were valued as critical to survival of the community.</p>
<p>As the capacity to produce continued to grow beyond the minimum for survival, the social and productive relations of matrilineal pre-class societies weakened.</p>
<p>Mother-right was overturned, and men came to control the wealth and resources, using organized violence and redeﬁned family institutions in the form of monogamous marriage to maintain their new position in society.</p>
<p>Engels describes the magnitude of this historical development:</p>
<p style="margin-left:15px">The overthrow of mother-right was the world historical defeat of the female sex. The man took command in the home also; the woman was degraded and reduced to servitude, she became the slave of his lust and a mere instrument for the production of children. This degraded position of the woman, especially conspicuous among the Greeks of the heroic and still more of the classical age, has gradually been palliated and glossed over, and sometimes clothed in a milder form; in no sense has it been abolished.</p>
<p>The origins of violence against women and the denial of women's right to control reproduction can be traced to this development. The overthrow of mother-right resulted in women essentially becoming the property of men. Female sexuality, once freely expressed, was now severely restricted in order to assure the "legitimate" line of descent from father to son for the purposes of inheritance. This was, in turn, tied to the emergence of class society itself, initially on the basis of slavery through warfare.</p>
<p>Engels explained:</p>
<p style="margin-left:15px">The increase of production in all branches — cattle-raising, agriculture, domestic handicrafts — gave human labor-power the capacity to produce a larger product than was necessary for its maintenance. At the same time, it increased the daily amount of work to be done by each member of the gens, household community or single family. It was now desirable to bring in new labor forces. War provided them; prisoners of war were turned into slaves. With its increase of the productivity of labor, and therefore of wealth, and its extension of the ﬁeld of production, the ﬁrst great social division of labor was bound, in the general historical conditions prevailing, to bring slavery in its train.</p>
<p style="margin-left:15px">From the ﬁrst great social division of labor arose the ﬁrst great cleavage of society into two classes: masters and slaves, exploiters and exploited.</p>
<p>Previously, the victors in war either killed or adopted those they defeated into their own tribes to contribute critical tasks of survival, but now, they enslaved the losers in order drive production and create wealth. Slavery was an early form of class society. The development of productive forces and advent of private property set into motion: (1) the emergence of the male-controlled family; (2) the emergence of class society itself. These are closely related, and in the modern form of capitalism, inextricable.²</p>

      <section id="a1s5">
        <h2>WOMEN'S OPPRESSION IN CAPITALIST SOCIETY</h2>
<p>Women's oppression has changed over time as economic exploitation has changed. Slavery, feudalism and capitalism all demonstrate the exploitation of people in class society. The oppression of women under capitalism manifests in a myriad of ways.</p>
<p>Capitalism is a class society driven by the generation of proﬁts. The capitalist class owns the means of production. This includes the factories and resources required to produce material goods, which run the gamut from shoes to houses. Resources include the means to access fuels, like oil, and even necessities like water. Capitalist production requires the employment of both male and female laborers. Since its inception, working-class women have been drawn out of the isolated atmosphere of the home and into collective production. Some of the ﬁrst factory workers were women.</p>
<p>And since its inception, capitalism has generated proﬁts by exploiting and undervaluing women in the workplace to a greater degree than men. This directly affects economic status, both by underpaying women and by excluding them from higher paying positions — relegating them to "gendered" positions that are typically service-oriented and lower-paying.</p>
<p>In the United States, women work longer hours and make less money than men. Even though equal pay for equal work has been federal law since 1963, when compared to men with similar education, skills and experience, women earn less than 76 cents to the dollar. For women of color, this is closer to 50 cents. In fact, the average 25-year-old working woman will lose almost $500,000 due to unequal pay during her lifetime as a worker. Yet, she will pay the same for rent, food, utilities and services as her male counterpart. In addition, she is likely to pay more for necessities like health care and more likely to lose money when she is sick. In the United States, among working women earning less than $40,000 per year, up to half are without basic beneﬁts, including secure, affordable health insurance, prescription drug coverage, pension or retirement beneﬁts, or paid sick leave.</p>
<p>This inequality allows capitalism to thrive. Lower pay for a sector of workers — women — plays two critical roles: (1) This directly translates to greater proﬁts because capitalists keep more of the value of the good or service by not paying as much to workers. (2) It also creates a division within the working class, pitting women and men against each other in the workplace because the availability of cheaper labor by women is a bargaining chip that allows capitalists to pay men less as well.</p>
<p>Beyond being underpaid in the workplace, women carry out a great amount of unpaid labor in capitalist society. This is because work like childcare, preparing food in the household and other similar work that was greatly valued in pre-communal society is not assigned a monetary value in capitalist society. Moreover, this work has been de-socialized. Often referred to as "the second shift," what used to be a communal responsibility has become the onus of individual women to complete on top of the work they perform for pay outside the home. Of course, these tasks are no less necessary to survival to the workforce, regardless of gender. As critical tasks performed at no cost to the capitalists, this unpaid labor — the exploitation of women — is a great source of proﬁt in capitalist society.</p>
<p>All of this makes women more likely to be poor. In 1978, professor Diana Pearce used the term "feminization of poverty" to describe trends in the standard of living in the United States. The fact that women perform unpaid labor, are more likely to perform lower-paying jobs, and that even when performing the same job are paid less means that under capitalism, women will always be poorer than their male counterparts simply because they are women. In the United States, almost 60 percent of adults with an income of less than half the poverty line are women. Black and Latina women have a much higher poverty rate than white women (generally two to three times as high).</p>
<p>In addition, the violence against women we see in today's capitalist society is a vestige of women's historic status as property — a status that emerged with and is inextricably tied to class society. Rather than a random or individual crime, violence against women is a symptom of women's subordinate position in modern class society. The sheer magnitude of violence against women around the world, including in the most advanced capitalist societies speaks to this. In the United States, every two minutes a women is sexually assaulted and every six minutes one is raped. This amounts to about 200,000 victims per year, with 17 percent of women having survived a complete or attempted rape. Domestic violence is the greatest form of injury to women in the United States, more than all other causes combined.</p>
<p>Moreover, the emergence of "global capitalism" has meant that all of these manifestations of women's oppression are being incorporated into business practices and imperialist military strategies worldwide.</p>
<p>Globally, women earn about 50 percent of what men earn and are the majority of the 1.5 billion people who survive on a dollar or less a day. In transnational sweatshops doing business under free-trade agreements like NAFTA, young women working for slave wages are routinely abused at work. Since 1993, more than 1,000 women and girls have been killed in Juarez, Mexico.</p>
<p>Most were workers in the "maquiladora" factories in the free-trade zone in the U.S.-Mexico border. Around the world, one in three women has been beaten, forced into sex or abused in her lifetime.</p>
<p>Despite militant struggle and the many hard-fought gains of the women's liberation movement, oppression continues on a broad scale, and every gain faces the threat of being rolled back. In the United States, one of every two women experience sexual harassment at school or work; homicide is the leading cause of death for pregnant women; women's health care rights, including reproductive rights, are increasingly under attack; and although abortion is legal, there are no abortion providers in 83 percent of U.S. counties. Critical programs like childcare, housing, education and health care are constantly under attack, if not outright denied or zeroed out.</p>
<p>In cases of violence against women, the police and the courts ﬁnd every excuse to avoid punishing the perpetrator. Every stage is a struggle: to have it recorded as a crime, to force an investigation, to force a prosecution, to force a trial, to win a conviction. Even when a woman wins at all of these stages, her subjugation by society remains ever apparent. That is what happened in the recent and notorious Stanford rape case, in which, despite his conviction by a jury for raping an unconscious woman and a request by prosecutors for six years, Judge Aaron</p>
<p>Persky sentenced Brock Allen Turner to only six months in jail. Persky's reason: a prison sentence would have a severe impact on Turner, and he would not be a danger to others.</p>
<p>Under capitalism, feminists ﬁght for — and can win — important rights and equality under the law. But capitalism relies on the subordination of sectors of the working class, including women. Without a state and society determined to enforce equal rights, and determined to deem the subordination of women and violence against women unacceptable — in the eyes of society and in the demonstrated enforcement of law — women will remain oppressed. This is exactly why a woman becoming president of the United States does not signal the liberation of women. The state she would lead is a capitalist state. It is a state constructed to uphold, what is necessary to uphold capitalism — exploitation, inequality and oppression — not to eliminate them. This is exactly why the full liberation of women is not possible within the capitalist system.</p>

        <h2>SOCIALISM LAYS THE BASIS FOR WOMEN'S LIBERATION</h2>
<p>Socialism lays the basis for two necessary steps toward women's liberation: (1) removing the inextricable motivation for women's oppression — the need to exploit workers in order to generate proﬁts; and (2) building a society and state committed to combatting oppression, and not just recognizing but also enforcing the equality of all workers.</p>
<p>In regards to this Sarah Sloan noted at a Party for Socialism and Liberation conference in 2014: Socialist revolutions have not happened in rich societies but in the poorest parts of the world. At the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Russian economy was one-twelfth the size of the U.S. economy. By eliminating the proﬁts for a tiny handful of capitalists, even a poor country like the Soviet Union, managed by the 1930s, to provide every worker with the right to a job and the right to free health care.</p>
<p>By 1960, the Soviet Union had emerged as the second-biggest economy in the world. There was no unemployment and there was a right to housing — to pay no more than 6 percent of your income for rent. Evictions were illegal because there were no landlords. It was your housing.</p>
<p>Women had a right to free childcare and one year's paid maternity leave, and they had the right to put their child in child care facilities at no cost. Women in the Soviet Union had the right to retire at 55 years of age at half pay. And remember, they had free health care, so retirement didn't mean being plunged into poverty. They had a month's paid vacation.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean that there were no problems in the Soviet Union, or that we agree with all the policies of different leaderships. But the Soviet Union proved, just as Cuba proves today, that when you take the wealth out of the hands of the capitalists, it can be used to meet people's needs.</p>
<p>Socialist Cuba has made enormous strides in combatting women's oppression since its revolution in 1959, which was declared socialist in 1961. And, as women leaders there often state, there is still much work to be done to achieve full equality.</p>
<p>In 1966, Fidel Castro spoke at the ﬁfth national plenum of the Cuban Women's Federation. Aware of the challenges that face a new socialist society after the overthrow of the ruling class, he described the ﬁght against women's oppression as a revolution within the socialist revolution. The vestiges of capitalist society's special oppression of people based on race and gender cannot be simply swept away with a revolution. The revolution begins the work of undoing those vestiges.</p>
<p>However, there is no comparison between the capitalist society of the United States and the socialist one of Cuba. Cuban women are guaranteed housing, health care, education and employment. Men and women are guaranteed parental leave for up to one year. Reproductive rights, abortion and birth control, for example, are legal and provided for by the national health care system. These are just a few examples but they are illustrative.</p>
<p>The United States has no guaranteed paid parental leave. Reproductive rights are constantly under attack. Housing, education, health care and employment are not considered rights.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s7">
        <h2>WE FIGHT FOR REFORMS AND STRUGGLE FOR FULL LIBERATION THROUGH SOCIALISM</h2>
<p>What, then, is women's liberation? The term evokes images of women leading marches, rallies, strikes and hunger strikes to demand the right to vote, to demand safe working conditions, to demand equal pay, the right to abortion and reproductive freedom; women standing together to demand an end to sexism and against sexual assault. It is marked by militant struggle in the face of extreme repression and by victories in the recognition of rights and changes in societal attitudes. The women's liberation movement militantly struggles for equal rights and status for women.</p>
<p>As revolutionary feminists, we must embrace the militancy of the women's liberation movement and carry it forward. We must remain strong and unwavering in our demand for equal rights. It is critical to ﬁght for as many rights recognized by law, for as many legal reforms, for as many changes in society thought and action as possible. All of this eases the oppression faced by women.</p>
<p>As socialists, we also understand that while militant struggle can win important rights in capitalist society, the women's liberation struggle reaches beyond the goal of equal rights. It is telling that after centuries of struggle, women still do not have equal rights under the law. What is even more telling is the other component of the struggle — that capitalist society continues to subject women to patriarchal norms; that in capitalist society, women remain oppressed.</p>
<p>When a society is built upon exploitation, as capitalism is, equality is contradictory to the system. This is the very reason why — even in the face of militant struggle — women do not have equal rights, and why even the rights we do have are rarely enforced and continuously threatened and eroded by legislatures and courts, instruments of the capitalist ruling class. Capitalism relies on social constructs, such as race and gender, to support the exploitation of groups of people that is necessary to generate proﬁts froms the labor of workers. By reclaiming political power from the capitalists, we attack the root of all bigotry and inequality based on these social constructs. In doing so, we lay the basis for the full liberation of women and all oppressed people.</p>

<p>[1] Women also participated in hunting, but men were the primary hunters and controllers of the process of the domestication of animals.</p>
<p>[2] The emergence of class society not only led to the oppression of women, it is also the root of LGBTQ oppression and bigotry. Maintaining the concentration of wealth in the upper class requires children who can inherit that wealth — same-sex relationships became valueless, although they naturally have continued. As is the oppression of women, the oppression of LGBTQ people is inextricably tied to today's capitalist society.</p>

      <h1>The Root Causes of the Attacks On Reproductive Rights</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">January 18, 2020</div>
      <div class="author">Karina Garcia</div>
      <hr>
<p><i>Originally published in Breaking the Chains Vol. 4, No 2: Not a Moral Issue.</i></p>
<p>Ten years ago, a speaker at a meeting, addressing the right-wing attacks on women's rights in the context of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, emphasized how important it was to elect pro-choice Democrats. The speaker gave no further explanation to the attacks.</p>
<p>At the time, the rightwing was attacking the ACA because it would expand abortion and contraception access. A couple years after it became law, the Supreme Court had already restricted access to birth control to "respect the religious beliefs" of corporations vis-a-vis reactionary owners. And to pass the ACA, the Democrats gladly compromised on reproductive rights. Obamacare ultimately continued to deny federal funds for abortion coverage and required that every state offer at least one insurance plan that did not cover abortions.</p>
<p>At the meeting, a young socialist woman spoke from the ﬂoor and criticized the speaker for not raising the "systematic" explanation. She said that capitalism was behind these patriarchal policies. She said that the bosses, the capitalists, want to restrict birth control and abortion because they want the working class to produce more workers and thereby drive down wages. On top of that they want to pay less in healthcare costs to cover their employees. I remember nodding in the moment that indeed there must be a deeper cause. I knew capitalism as a system was implicated. What she was saying had a logic to it. But when I went home it started to make a lot less sense.</p>
<p>Do the capitalists really need more workers? Millions of people are unemployed as it is and they are incarcerating the "surplus" population. Is it really possible that the capitalists would conspire in this way to restrict abortion rights, but none of them would ever slip up and admit it? Why is it that some Democrats support abortion rights then? They too represent the capitalist class' interests. It cannot just be about forcing women to produce more workers.</p>
<p>And as for costs and proﬁts, the Affordable Care Act was going to make mega-proﬁts for insurance companies, the healthcare sector and the banks, with or without abortion coverage, so why try to tank the bill on that basis? It was not really only about proﬁt either.</p>
<p>She was right that the attack was "systematic" and that these sexist policies are linked to capitalism, but there seemed to be more to the answer than she had presented. I dove into the Marxist and historical writing about the antiabortion movement because I wanted to understand this and be able to explain it — for myself and others.</p>
<p>The Marxist approach to women's oppression and liberation is often misunderstood or mischaracterized. In university settings it is portrayed as "economic determinism" or "reductionism" — asserting that Marxists reduce every issue to economics. In a way, that is what the socialist speaking from the ﬂoor was doing in that meeting.</p>
<p>But that is not an accurate description of the Marxist method.</p>
<p>It is true that Marxists emphasize the importance of the economic system, in that the mode of production plays a critical role in shaping the economic system and the structures of society. Marxists start by looking at how a society produces and reproduces itself and the norms, laws and relationships under which production and reproduction take place. That is what "economics" really means anyway. At its base, every society is engaged in producing and reproducing.</p>
<p>The ideas, laws, formal institutions and religions, what Marx called the superstructure, are used to justify, strengthen, and stabilize those underlying processes and relations at the base of production and reproduction.</p>
      <section id="a2s1">
        <h2>THE CAPITALIST MODE OF PRODUCTION AND THE FAMILY</h2>
<p>Under capitalism there are some people who own the means of production (land, factories, technology, etc.), while others go to work every day and work on those means of production. They generate proﬁts that go back to the owners. That exploitation is at the base of society. But that arrangement would not last a single day if it was not backed up by the laws, the courts, the police — which protect the owners and landlords — the schools, media, politicians and religious institutions that have taught us since day one that this is the normal and perfectly natural way of things.</p>
<p>The capitalist mode of production developed historically out of previous modes of production, including slavery and feudalism. Capitalism represented a major change in the dominant form of property and labor relations. Many other things changed as a result of that. Racism and white supremacy are part and parcel of the foundation of modern capitalism. In the case of the United States, colonial dispossession and racialized chattel slavery were the foundations for the accumulation of wealth within the capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p>Capitalism did not simply erase the pre-existing world and start with a blank slate. Patriarchy has existed since the dawn of class society and is part of the fabric of the capitalist system. In pre-class society, before private ownership of property there was a much more diverse set of family arrangements and women generally played a leadership role for the community as a whole.</p>
<p>After those pre-class modes of production were overthrown, and eventually the forms of social and family organization alongside them, women were held in a subordinate position and male supremacy became the law. For thousands of years, women's basic conditions and status were conﬁned to the home. Law, custom and ideology held women to a dependent status and entirely subject to the whims of the leading male in the family. Housework and child rearing, in addition to ongoing work in the ﬁelds (in the case of agricultural societies), were delineated as "women's work." This was a central element to modes of production based on private property.</p>
<p>In the United States today, the capitalist mode of production has changed in many ways, as has the shape and detail of the superstructure, but core historic features persist. While women can enter the wage workforce and women can legally own property and have independent political and civil rights, the basic unit of what has been called social reproduction is the nuclear family. In that family, women carry out the vast majority of the labor in the household, in child rearing and in elder care. Because this family form has been carried over in its essential characteristics, all the values, traditions and cultural norms that developed to explain and justify male supremacy have been largely carried over too.</p>
<p>While capitalism has broken down many of the economic relationships that were at the heart of a nuclear family, the family has not been abolished or collapsed entirely. The family unit has changed, but the precarious existence of workers under capitalism makes it necessary for most workers to have a family to survive. One income is not enough. Take, for example, the conditions of so many LGBTQ youth who have been rejected by their families. To not have a family is to be subjected to the worst forms of deprivation, homelessness and brutality that capitalism has to offer.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the capitalist system, the family unit is highly valuable — especially as it relates to the reproduction and caring for the next generation of workers. Lisa Vogel highlights this in her social reproduction theory. Others have taken it in different directions, highlighting the other forms of labor that are often unpaid or underpaid, but are nonetheless essential for reproducing a workforce that is healthy and stable enough to continue to come into work.</p>

        <h2>REACTIONARY WORLDVIEW EXPLAINS ECONOMIC SHIFTS</h2>
<p>How does this relate to the attacks on women's rights and attacks on women's growing assertiveness in challenging sexual violence and sexist rhetoric? These do not present themselves as issues of the basic functioning of the mode of production. They can appear distinct and separate, so people ﬁghting for women's rights on these fronts might not see the linkage to capitalism. And yet more and more activists are talking about systemic patriarchy. The Party for Socialism and Liberation's banners that say, "The whole system is sexist! Fight for socialism!" have been very popular in these movements.</p>
<p>Here we are talking about struggles in the world of politics and culture, the superstructure. They appear as ﬁghts within capitalism — in the sense that you should be able to ﬁght for and achieve full abortion rights and other reproductive services under capitalism. In some countries that already exists. You should be able to reduce sexual harassment or violence or eliminate it altogether under capitalism. At least, in theory, it is not pivotal to the mode of production.</p>
<p>But if that is the case, why are those gains so hard to win? Why do socialists insist a revolution would be necessary to really achieve them? It is because domination over women remains a pillar of the U.S. capitalist class's form of rule.</p>
<p>Abortion access became a major political issue starting in the late 1970s as a cornerstone of an emerging reactionary trend. A reactionary is someone who says that things were better in society before they changed. "Make America Great Again" is a true reactionary slogan. It implies we should return to the past. Big sections of the ruling class turn to a reactionary agenda when they feel that their social control is slipping in the face of a powerful social movement, or when capitalism itself has destabilized the economy and when life seems more uncertain for big sections of the population.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, both were happening in the United States. The mass uprisings of the 1960s and early 70s with the struggles for women's liberation, Black liberation, LGBTQ liberation and the anti-war movement were powerful challenges to the U.S. capitalist status quo. The Vietnamese anti-colonial resistance defeated U.S. imperialism, a major blow, while imperialism was engaged in constant heated confrontation with the socialist bloc.</p>
<p>The U.S. economy also went into a period of recession during which layoffs and unemployment increased, and consumer spending decreased. Capitalist recessions are cyclical and occur regularly because of overproduction. From 1979 to 1984, approximately 11.5 million workers either lost their jobs or shifted to lower-paying service jobs. Most of the jobs lost were in manufacturing industries such as steel, auto, mining and electronics.</p>
<p>The reactionaries have a powerful appeal and socialists should understand how it works. They say essentially "Your life used to be better, right? You're feeling less sure about your future right? Well, that's understandable because look at how much has changed. We've lost our way. And now we're going to hell in a handbasket unless we turn back." Then they link that to whatever issue, whether it be abortion, sex education, LGBTQ rights and so on. The reactionaries sometimes blame the "weak" government, which has bent to pressure and refused to defend "our values," while at other times attacking the government for being "too big."</p>
<p>Another example is how the economic ravaging of whole Black communities is laid at the feet of Black women "having too many children out of wedlock" or the absence of Black male role models. This reactionary worldview builds upon the extreme racist character of the U.S. capitalist system along with thousands of years of ingrained cultural indoctrination that with a "strong" family — that is with men and women in their "proper place" — everything will be ﬁne.</p>
<p>This sort of reactionary worldview offers an all-purpose explanation for general problems or unsettling changes. Politicians then conveniently avoid discussion of the actual causes of social and economic distress, i.e., capitalist instability. Furthermore it coincides with making use of explanations being cultivated in conservative religious institutions, which tend to focus on going back to a more moral time, and theorize the problems of modern society as a reﬂection of an absence of godliness and values. So these ideas and theories are already circulating and can easily be picked up on by a politician who wants to present himself as a champion of "family values" while not actually doing anything to change families' material conditions.</p>
<p>The "New Right," ascending in the Republican Party in the late 1970s, started to really focus on abortion in the 1980s and 90s. Abortion rights were identiﬁed as a weak spot for the women's movement because it had been secured in the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, not via legislation. There was existing opposition on religious grounds that they could mobilize, and there were big parts of the country where abortion rights had become law but the movement was weak.</p>
<p>Evangelical mega-churches and televangelists were entering politics in a big way — most famously in the "Moral Majority" — and becoming signiﬁcant powerbrokers to handpick and groom elected representatives. They delivered considerable resources and a captive audience to enterprising politicians, who would take on their framing of issues. The whole Moral Majority movement became a target base of support for hardright capitalists who personally did not care much about abortion or other moral issues, but who wanted to turn back government regulations, social spending and labor unions. Over time, this relationship produced a major pipeline of campaign funds and airtime.</p>
<p>In short, abortion became a preferred electoral issue, quickly moving from local and state to federal politics. Right-wing politicians could portray pro-choice Democrats as "baby killers" and link them to the "decline of the family." It is not so much that these issues in and of themselves threaten capitalists proﬁts. They offered a way for one sector of the capitalist class — leaning on the powerful institutions of the superstructure in their areas to consolidate political legitimacy — to distract constituents from social and economic concerns that the politicians have no desire to address.</p>
<p>It became a central political strategy for the conservative right. The Republican Party used to be considered just the pro-business and law-and-order party. Some were actually liberal on "social issues." But as the party moved far right, that has changed.</p>
<p>In the United States, where money controls so much of politics, the agenda is set by the highest bidder. With the near obliteration of campaign ﬁnance laws, this has become more overt. A few billionaires could say, "These are my political interests, these are my priorities and I'm going to throw my money around only to those who take on my agenda and my interests." When Marx said that the "the ruling ideas of a society are the ideas of its ruling class," he meant the general inﬂuence of ruling class ideals, but today that inﬂuence is also due to direct intervention of the ruling class. In the absence of a ﬁghtback movement, the reactionary obsessions of some really rich men can set the tone of politics, and actually determine major issues for hundreds of millions of working-class women in the United States and worldwide.</p>
<p>The anti-abortion billionaires are not spending their money because it will help their immediate proﬁts. If anything they are spending signiﬁcant parts of their fortunes on these right-wing causes. That is where capitalism comes back in at the systematic level. It is not as a conspiracy for proﬁts, but as a form of political rule based on disciplining and intimidating one section of poor and working people, distracting and confusing others, and ﬁnally winning over and satisfying other layers.</p>
<p>No mode of production based on extreme inequality and exploitation would be able to last long if it did not have ruling institutions, political systems, ideas, traditions and so on that protected and rationalized those economic processes. The ruling class does not just get to extract wealth; it also has to ﬁnd stable ways to rule.</p>
<p>Forms of patriarchy operate powerfully at the base of capitalism, in how the system produces and reproduces itself on a daily basis. It also is a cornerstone at this superstructural level, and in particular as a central element of the reactionary agenda. So how could patriarchy be ended under capitalism if it is so embedded at every level of the capitalist system? It is impossible.</p>
<p>Socialism, by contrast, eliminates the economic dependence on the family unit. Simply by changing who controls and owns the vast means of production, every person can now be guaranteed housing, food, healthcare, childcare, retirement and other human needs as guaranteed rights. The gender pay gap and undervaluing of "women's work" could essentially be overturned overnight. A government in the hands of class-conscious workers would also remove from power the lackeys of the billionaire bigots, and instead launch bold initiatives to advance women's equality and liberation in the world of culture, ideology, education and politics.</p>
<p>This would be an ongoing process, of course, but it would be fundamentally different from the battle for women's rights under capitalism. In the present, we ﬁght for rights inside a system that reproduces patriarchal economic relationships daily and under a ruling class that defaults to a reactionary agenda as a way to protect its exploitative rule. That is why "smashing the patriarchy" often feels so impossible. Under socialism, by contrast, the battle will be to win an egalitarian superstructure that will harmonize with a new economic system based on meeting the needs of all.</p>

      <h1>Socially Reproductive Work Is Indispensable Yet Unpaid</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">March 2023</div>
      <div class="author">Candice Yanez</div>
      <hr>
<p><i>Originally published in Breaking the Chains Vol. 8, No. 1: The Political Economy Of Women's Liberation.</i></p>
<p>Eighty-seven years ago, during the wake of the Great Depression, communist organizer Marvel Cooke and civil rights activist Ella Baker opened their groundbreaking article, "The Bronx Slave Market," as follows;</p>
<p>"I was a slave."</p>
<p>The exposé, published by The Crisis, the newspaper of the NAACP in 1935, documents the "slave markets" that proliferated the streets of New York City, where Black women gathered on the crowded corners of 167th street and Jerome Avenue and at Simpson and Westchester Avenues.</p>
<p>Aﬄuent families were hiring Black women⏤already systematically coerced into low-paying and undervalued work before the Depression⏤for as low as 15 to 20 cents an hour for arduous domestic labor.</p>
<p>Today, Cooke and Baker's article remains a landmark analysis of the women's work that goes undervalued and is simultaneously indispensable for the functioning of capitalism.</p>
<p>Karl Marx's Labor Theory of Value describes that every commodity has both a "use value" and an "exchange value." Wages are the exchange value (what a commodity is sold for) of labor power. The use value, or the physical properties of the commodity, is its utility in meeting a need. Labor performed at home, primarily but not exclusively by women, has a "use value." The expected and normalized routine work of the home⏤cooking, cleaning, washing, and caring for children⏤meets the needs required to sustain the reproduction of labor power. Housework, in other words, ensures that the working class has their needs met to then go back out to work every day.</p>
<p>Exploitation is essential to capitalism. The system relies on women's unpaid labor in the home. When the same work is done for exchange as a commodity, it is then given an exchange value in the form of wages. In a capitalist society, when this labor in the home is performed by paid workers, the exchange value of domestic labor power is driven down by the vast numbers of women performing the same work in the home for free.</p>
<p>In general, "gendered" work, or socially reproductive work in patriarchal, capitalist society, is underpaid relative to jobs typically performed by men. Teachers, especially those working with preschool age children; nurses; and house cleaners are paid less than those in jobs requiring similar skills, training and effort but typically performed by men. "Pink collar" jobs are seen as an outgrowth of the unpaid work performed by women in the home, even when the career has evolved considerably to require signiﬁcant levels of advanced education, as in the cases of nursing and teaching.</p>
<p>In the United States, as exempliﬁed by the Bronx Slave Market, the underpayment of "women's work" is intertwined with white supremacy and the legacies of slavery and colonialism. During the period of chattel slavery, enslaved women performed domestic work for other people's families without receiving a wage. After the formal end of slavery, Black women were blocked from entering other professions and forced into domestic labor. To this day, domestic workers from other countries that are dominated by the United States are often trafficked to the United States where they are held literally captive by their employers in conditions of near slavery.</p>
<p>Nearly a century ago, Baker and Cooke argued that the unionization of domestic workers was an essential demand and goal for better conditions. Unionization wasn't unheard of. In July 1881, Black laundresses formed the Washing Society, a trade organization in Atlanta. The Washing Society, which grew from 20 to 3,000 washerwomen in a matter of weeks, organized a strike demanding a set price ($1 per basket) for their work. It was not the only organization of this kind.</p>
<p>Unionization of waged domestic workers can improve their pay and workplace conditions. This still leaves the question of the unpaid worker in the home, whether full time or doing housework as part of the "second shift."</p>
      <section id="a3s1">
        <h2>UNPAID WORK IN THE HOME HAS A HIGH MONETARY VALUE</h2>
<p>"Hey, fellas! Could you afford $48,000 to hire these women? Because that's what a housewife is worth." So reads the headline of a 1970s edition of the National Enquirer.</p>
<p>Oxfam and the Institute for Women's Policy Research recently reported that the monetary value of unpaid care work is nearly $11 trillion a year. This work, which amounts to about 12.5 billion hours a year, where women make up three-quarters of the unpaid care workers and two-thirds paid care workers, sustains the capitalist system through systematic exploitation based on race and gender.</p>
<p>On October 24, 1975, a general strike occurred in Iceland, where 90 percent of women took the day off to show the economic impact of their labor. Known as the Women's Day Off in Iceland, women abstained from childcare and domestic work.</p>
<p>The strike forced bosses and the employers to take on secretarial and other administrative duties.</p>
<p>Other industries and sectors had to shut down. Schools closed for the duration of the strike because the majority of teachers were women. Even airlines had to cancel ﬂights because of the lack of ﬂight attendants⏤another historically gendered profession.</p>
<p>While this and similar campaigns raised political consciousness about women's work and led to critical reforms that improved conditions, many serious challenges remain. Even though more women have entered the labor force, their domestic responsibilities have not decreased.</p>
<p>There are limited options in the current societal structure to get housework done. One option to those in relationships may be to ﬁght within the relationship to share the housework. Shared housework can reduce the burden on a single individual but it remains individualized. Some with sufficient disposable income can hire domestic workers as nannies, housekeepers or cooks. This solution passes the burden on to someone else who is being paid less than what you earn for working outside of their home to clean up your home. This solution is also not available to most workers. Neither of these "solutions" resolves the problem that unpaid or poorly paid socially reproductive labor is both oppressive and underpins the system of exploitation.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a3s2">
        <h2>MAKING SOCIALLY REPRODUCTIVE WORK COLLECTIVE AND PUBLIC</h2>
<p>The socialization of domestic and educational work is needed to truly lift the burden. Socialist revolutions in Russia, China and Cuba saw immediate gains for women by making socially reproductive work collective and public.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, the Soviet Union legalized abortion and the right to divorce. The post-revolution transitional government implemented measures to promote socialized domestic work. In contrast, capitalist countries hadn't even introduced women's most basic rights-such as the right to vote-until after the Russian Revolution guaranteed this right to women in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Soviet revolutionaries, with proletariat support, introduced a radical program that encompassed the socialization of household labor through public dining halls, daycare centers and laundries. Similarly, China socialized household duties by introducing collective nurseries and dining halls to alleviate women's second shift at home.</p>
<p>Cuba's Family Code, which went into effect on International Women's Day in 1975, pushed society to reconsider and reorganize household duties, and move toward women's liberation and true equality. The Code promotes equal household responsibilities between men and women. As Article 26 states:</p>
<p>Both parties must care for the family they have created and each must cooperate with the other in the education, upbringing and guidance of the children... They must participate, to the extent of their capacity or possibilities, in the running of the home and cooperate so that it will develop in the best possible way.</p>
<p>The code also gives labor rights to full-time caregivers for children, the elderly and people with disabilities. Other efforts in Cuba implemented to end women's domestic slavery and the second shift include socialized childcare and even public services like "Plan Jaba" which allows women to drop off bags and shopping lists at grocery stores for the items to be picked up later in the evening.</p>
<p>Every socialist state in history has codiﬁed fundamental rights into law that guarantee women's equality unambiguously and as a matter of priority. There was more than just paper behind these laws. The laws serve as tangible means to actualize women's liberation through collective problem solving and public solutions. They can inform collectivized reproductive work under a socialist system in the United States.</p>

      <h1>The Political Economy of Women's Oppression</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">March 2023</div>
      <div class="author">Marissa Sanchez</div>
      <hr>
<p><i>Originally published in Breaking the Chains Vol. 8, No. 1: The Political Economy Of Women's Liberation.</i></p>
<p>Many mothers are utterly familiar with their child asking themselves or others: "Why is my mommy so tired?" Mommy is often tired because she works at her job and she works at home. The work can seem endless, and parts of it often seem unimportant or unrecognized and a responsibility for her only.</p>
<p>The answer to the child's question lies in the political economy of women's oppression under capitalism. Mommy is tired because she is an exploited worker who also continues to shoulder many of the responsibilities of social reproduction that are unvalued, like cooking for her family or cleaning the home. The social and economic inequalities experienced by women, certainly not only mothers, are rooted in the very nature and function of capitalism as a system. Capitalism is based, as Karl Marx explained, on the production of commodities on a mass scale. Commodities must be both usable and exchangeable in the capitalist marketplace. However, goods and services produced for household consumption or as gifts, for example, are not commodities. Commodities are goods, possessing a use value, that are produced by human labor for exchange.</p>
<p>Marx wrote about the special commodity that is "labor power." Labor power is the ability to work over a given period of time. Working-class people are exploited by not being paid for the full value produced by their labor, that is how the capitalists make a proﬁt. We do not accumulate wealth for ourselves under capitalism, but instead for the capitalist owners. All we can do is sell our labor power, for a wage or a salary. Women workers sell their labor power and suffer further inequalities on the job. Capitalism exploits workers to create proﬁts and women face additional exploitation based on gender and, for a large section of working-class women, national oppression as well. The wage gap between men and women has not narrowed much over the last 15 years. The 2020 U.S. Census Bureau states that women earned 83 cents for every dollar made by men. Black and Latina women are at even greater pay disadvantage earning 64% and 57% of what white men were paid in 2020. To further exacerbate unequal pay, the Department of Labor reports that in 2019, segregation by industry and occupation cost Black women an estimated $30.3 billion and Latina women $46.7 billion from lower wages compared to white men.</p>
<p>According to a 2020 Bureau of Labor Statistics report, women on average spend 5.7 hours per day on work in the home, as compared to 3.6 hours for men. This amounts to nearly 95 more eight-hour work days per year of unpaid labor for women, which at the average wage is the equivalent of $1.48 trillion! It is this unpaid labor that makes "women's work" distinctive. The work within the home does not generally produce commodities, despite the considerable amount of labor that goes into household production and management. Every meal prepared, garment repaired, schoolwork reviewed, laundry done etc. is work that produces "use-values" but not exchange values. It is absolutely essential to capitalist production and reproduction but is demeaned because it does not directly create proﬁt for the capitalists. It is that work that sustains the present workforce while preparing the workforce of the future.</p>
<p>When women get off work, go home and continue to perform a "second shift" of unpaid household labor, we are doing socially necessary work that has no value ascribed to it by the capitalist system. A recent study found that during the emerging economic crisis in 2020 "household production could provide a buffer to the decline in market work because some of the hours that were used in market production could shift to household production." It was primarily women who stopped working during COVID to care for children no longer attending school in person. It was most often women who cooked meals at home as restaurants closed. It was overwhelmingly women who cared for the sick. At the same time, billionaires increased their wealth by 40 percent.</p>
<p>What does capitalism gain from the continued special oppression of women? Capitalists proﬁt from the super- or extra-exploitation of women workers on the job and from the unpaid reproductive labor in the home. At the same time, it is important to understand that beyond economic factors there are structural and social forces that keep women oppressed.</p>
<p>The social and economic inequalities experienced by women are rooted in the very nature and function of capitalism as a system. Women's oppression arose through the historical development of class society and is deeply embedded in the development of capitalist society. Today, women make up the majority of workers in healthcare, education and government jobs. More than two-thirds of the workers at grocery store checkouts and fast food counters are women. Seventy-eight percent of social workers are women. Women are an essential factor in the workforce. Without women workers, the economy would grind to a halt. Yet women work in the lowest paid sectors and make lower wages than their male counterparts. Maintaining a large section of the working class in traditionally lower paid and unstable work through sexism and gender-based oppression provides a social and political beneﬁt to the system as well--keeping the working class divided amongst itself.</p>
<p>The contradiction of the centrality of women workers to the economy and the worsening of conditions for working-class women is bringing women into struggle. We know we have power and for many women conditions have become intolerable. Conditions are not just intolerable at work, they are often also intolerable at home. The COVID-19 pandemic, rising prices, supply shortages, environmental disasters, infrastructure failures and the childcare crisis have all made the labor of reproducing everyday life more difficult. Women have been playing an ever-expanding role in the mass organization of workers, and the current conditions point to their potential to continue to do so. Women are on the frontlines of union drives, are leading struggles to demand living wages and digniﬁed working conditions, and are building grassroots organizations to ﬁght to expand our democratic rights.</p>
<p>Reforms are not enough to eliminate the oppression women face under capitalism; the root of women's oppression is the capitalist system. Socialism removes the economic basis for women's oppression. It lays the foundation for liberating women from the economic imperatives that have resulted in a social and political organization that maintains women's oppression. A society organized with an entirely different economic and political structure will enable us to do away with the cultural norms that keep us attached to the performance of unpaid household labor. It is only socialism that can organize society in such a way as to eliminate this kind of labor altogether.</p>
<p>Under socialism, production will be planned based on the needs of the people and the society as a whole, rather than the proﬁts of a tiny minority of wealthy individuals. Domestic labor will be valued as a necessity for the survival of the entire community, and understood as meaningful work that produces and reproduces our social world. With the development of socialism, women's roles will no longer be circumscribed. No longer will women be expected to engage in hours of drudgery when cooking, cleaning and providing care for children and the elderly. Increased meal services, laundry services, housekeeping services, kindergartens, free daycares and home healthcare services will be collectively organized to ensure that all basic human needs are met. Under socialism, reproductive labor will be viewed as essential and meaningful work, as will all labor that contributes to the beneﬁt of the people. It will be performed by all workers no matter their gender. By bringing domestic work into a socialized form of production, the workers who bear its burden most under capitalism will be able to enjoy the beneﬁts of home — a space to rest, be comfortable, and engage in free time — in an equal way because we will no longer be the sole producers of it.</p>

        <h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>
<p>made her mark in the struggle for working women in the huge Cheektowaga plant (near Buffalo) of the Westinghouse Corporation, which is organized in Local 1581 of the International Union of Electrical Workers, CIO-AFL. She worked as a punch press operator, a low-paid, unskilled job, classiﬁed as Labor Grade 3. The company had divided the work force into 10 labor grades. Although the women in the plant constituted almost half the work force, they were all concentrated in Labor Grade 1 to 3, the lowest paid, unskilled jobs. The other 7 grades were, of course, for men. By defying the company's discriminatory practice and mobilizing the support of union men and women, she broke the ban and won a bid for a Labor Grade 7 job — that of die-setter — on the punch press—never before performed by a woman. It was a ﬁrst in the electrical industry. She also was a steward of a section of about 1000 workers; also an elected member of the Executive Board and one of the four top officers of Local 1581. Earlier she had been ﬁrst a volunteer organizer and then a full-time organizer for Local 292 of United Paper Workers Union, CIO, in New York City.</p>

        <h2>THE WOMAN IN HISTORY</h2>
<p>There is a profound revolutionary upsurge going on today that is shaking the very foundations of capitalist civilization. It can be seen in all phases of life: on the campus, on the picket line, more recently in the ranks of organized labor, above all in the Black liberation movement, and even in the church.</p>
<p>So it is no surprise that there is also a widespread resurgence for women's liberation despite the campaign of the ruling class to ridicule and distort it in an effort to obliterate its very progressive character.</p>
