<button class="classmodule">February 9th | Candidacy Class #4: Introduction to Marxism</button>
<div class="panel">
<div class="blurb">
The objective of this class is to develop a basic understanding of how the contradictions inherent in capitalism create both subjective and objective foundations for a socialist revolution. This includes the ability to articulate fundamental concepts of Marxism—such as surplus value, exploitation, overproduction, and primitive accumulation—and to apply these concepts to personal experiences or political struggles. Additionally, it seeks to foster an understanding of Marxism as an essential tool, both as a theory and a method, for empowering working and oppressed peoples in advancing their side of the class struggle.

<br><br>

<b>Keep these guiding questions in mind as you read:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Why do we say that the capitalists and the working class have opposing interests? How does this relate to the struggle over value and surplus-value?</li>
<li>What does it mean to think like a marxist?</li>
<li>How is capitalism today, holding back humanity’s development or obstructing our productive power?</li>
<li>How does class struggle drive history? How can marxism help you understand and lead struggles in your area?</li>

The objective of this class is to understand the Party’s analysis of the origins of women’s oppression, how it manifests in society and why only socialism will lead to women’s liberation, examine the struggle for reproductive rights and how the attack on abortion access is a key issue within the women’s right movements that impacts the entire working class, and engage in a discussion on what it means to fight for women’s liberation and the critical importance of developing women cadre and leaders within the Party.
