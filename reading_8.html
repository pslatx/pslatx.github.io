      <h1>What is imperialism? An introduction</h1>
      <hr>

      <hr>
      <p><i>Editor's note: A Spanish translation of this article is available <a href="https://www.liberationschool.org/que-es-el-imperialismo-una-introduccion/">here</a>.</i></p>
      <p>In the suﬀering of the Global South, the brutality of capitalism lies bare. In a footnote toward the end of Capital, Marx wrote that the colonized subject reveals "what the bourgeois makes of itself and of the labourer, wherever it can, without restraint, model the world after its own image" [1]. The forms of primary accumulation he articulates there were in their most naked form in the colonies. Contrary to liberal and academic misreadings, Marx paid great attention to the relationship between colonialism and capitalism. Marx came to argue that colonialism was the backbone of capitalism, and that anti-colonial movements could even be the key to global capitalism's overthrow. This is why anti-colonial struggles have long been guided to victory by Marxist theory.</p>
      <p>As proletarians living within the imperial core, it is our task to unite with our class across nations. When capital moves across borders, so must proletarian solidarity. As revolutionaries in the United States, we must understand and ﬁght against the global system of imperialism from within, for "no nation can be free if it oppresses other nations" [2].</p>      <section id="a1s1">
        <h2>MARX ON COLONIALISM AND ANTI-COLONIAL STRUGGLES</h2>
        <p>Marx analyzed capitalism in Britain for his major work because data on the country's industrial system was rich and accessible, and because it was where capitalism was most highly developed at the time. However, Marx was clear that British capitalism was not conﬁned to Britain, and that the object of study was Britain as a capitalist and colonizing power. British industrial capitalism was advanced because of its stature as a colonial power.</p>
        <p>Marx's critique of political economy showed how the prevailing ideas of colonialism were reactionary and not in the interests of British workers. For example, he noted how British colonies like Ireland could be utilized for excess labor-power and how wage laborers can't be free while slavery exists. Most famously, he wrote that British capital was accumulated through "conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder," and more speciﬁcally through national and international debts, "the discovery of gold and silver… the</p>
        <p>extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population," and "the conquest and looting of the East Indies" [3].</p>
        <p>The study that examines the political economy of Britain ends with a chapter on colonialism because Marx knew that, while capital's contradictions couldn't be solved without revolution, they could be pushed back and displaced through intensiﬁed colonial expansion. In fact, Marx's theory of value was a global theory of value, as value necessarily expands and requires capitalist powers to engage in colonial and, later, imperialist practices [4]. Colonialism is explicitly mentioned, for example, as a process that can counter the tendency for the rate of proﬁt to fall [5].</p>
        <p>Moreover, Marx even acknowledged that uprisings in the colonized world could spark workers' uprisings in the colonial motherland. During the Taiping Rebellion in China-which Marx supported wholeheartedly-he wrote:</p>
        <p>"It may seem a very strange, and very paradoxical assertion that the next uprising of the people of Europe, and their next movement for republican freedom and economy of government, may depend more probably on what is now passing in the Celestial Empire" [6].</p>
        <p>Even during Marx's time, what we today call the Global South-including Africa, Asia, and Latin America-were, along with oppressed nations in the North, exploited for the enrichment of the colonizing capitalist states.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s2">
        <h2>FROM COLONIALISM TO IMPERIALISM</h2>
        <p>Yet it wasn't until after Marx died that the shift from colonialism to imperialism began. Marx died in 1883, just before the 1884 Conference of Berlin rapidly accelerated the transition to a global imperialist order. Less than 20 years later, the imperialist powers had terrorized, plundered, and looted almost all of Africa, stripping away long histories of self-governance.</p>
        <p>For a deﬁnition of imperialism, we have to turn to Lenin, who can help us understand what imperialism really is, and why it isn't an adjective that describes particular policies of certain administrations, but instead refers to a particular stage of capitalist development. Lenin distinguishes imperialism from colonialism in the following manner:</p>
        <p>The characteristic feature of the period under review is the ﬁnal partition of the globe—ﬁnal, not in the sense that a repartition is impossible; on the contrary, repartitions are possible and inevitable—but in the sense that the colonial policy of the capitalist countries has completed the seizure of the unoccupied territories of our planet. For the ﬁrst time the world is completely divided up, so that in the future only redivision is possible, i.e., territories can only pass from one "owner" to another, instead of passing as ownerless territory to an "owner" [7].</p>
        <p>Imperialism began when the colonizing powers had already divided the world between themselves. The only way to expand from that point on was to re-divide the colonial territories, which inevitably meant war. Such redivisions were at the roots of the First and Second World Wars.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s3">
        <h2>IMPERIALISM: CAPITALIST WARS AND REVOLUTIONARY SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>"Imperialism," Lenin wrote, "is the highest stage in the development of capitalism" [8]. This means there is no separating imperialism from capitalism: one is a stage within the other.</p>
        <p>Capitalism has, since its birth, used legal and extralegal violence to accumulate wealth in the hands of the capitalist class through a process called primary accumulation. Within England, one of capitalism's ﬁrst acts was expropriating peasants from their land, forcibly converting them into wage laborers and transforming their means of subsistence into commodities they had to purchase. Such dispossession was carried out by state and individual terrorism. The colonized world suﬀered a similar yet sharper fate, as we saw Marx describe above.</p>
        <p>Writing during the beginning of World War I, Lenin wrote that "capitalism only became capitalist imperialism at a deﬁnite and very high stage of its development, when certain of its fundamental characteristics began to change into their opposites" [9]. "Economically," he writes, "the main thing in this process is the displacement of capitalist free competition by capitalist monopoly" [10]. Gone were the (brief) days when small businesses competed with each other in limited markets. Instead, capital was centralized in fewer and fewer hands. "Capitalism has grown into a world system of colonial oppression and of the ﬁnancial strangulation of the overwhelming majority of the population of the world by a handful of 'advanced' countries," Lenin wrote [11]. Their "booty" accrues to a handful of imperialist powers "who are drawing the whole world into their war over the division of their booty" [12].</p>
        <p>Some thought that the tendency toward monopoly would result in one single company for every industry, which would represent a limit to capitalism within capitalism. Yet during economic crises and due to state intervention, such monopolies never cohered. Today, major corporations and ﬁnancial institutions, largely located in the Global North, have conglomerated and vertically integrated to the extent that a handful of monopolies dominate the entire international economy. To be sure, they're often separate entities, but they're united by ﬁnance and the state. Lenin referred to the then-new phenomenon of the merging of industrial and banking capital as "ﬁnance capital," a form of capitalism that is still dominant today.</p>
        <p>Because of this drive toward monopoly, capitalism cannot be reformed into a peaceful regime. Capitalism can never become anti-imperialist, non-imperialist, or, to use the phrase of Lenin's target, Karl Kautsky, "ultra" or "super-imperialist." Kautsky believed that the territorial expansion of capitalism had reached its limits and that the only solution was for the powerful nations to form a bloc and establish an equilibrium. Lenin said this state was merely a "truce" between wars.</p>
        <p>Governments of imperialist countries act in the interests of these monopolies, using their armies and militaries to pursue their objectives. The U.S. military is an extension of capital's drive to constantly conquer new markets and resources, even when it creates them through destruction. It goes to war to compete with other imperialist rivals for markets and resources, to keep rising capitalist powers in their place, to oppress independent and socialist nations, to ﬁnd new markets, resources, and springs of proﬁt, and to mitigate against worker rebellions at home.</p>
        <p>When Israel bombs Palestine or the U.S. launches airstrikes against Syria, sanctions Venezuela, or blockades Cuba, these are not individual policy decisions, nor are they the result of any single politician's mindset. These are economically necessary and structural features of capitalism that cannot be reformed away. To be sure, there is a great deal of debate within the U.S. political and military establishments over what particular policies to pursue, means to deploy, and objectives to attain at particular junctures. Yet, the consensus remains: the U.S. won't accept any challenge to its imperialist dominance.</p>
        <p>The only solution is the overthrow of capitalist imperialism, and the building of socialism. By its very deﬁnition, imperialism needs to dominate every market, raw material, natural resource, and worker on the planet. The tactics it deploys to do so are varied, ranging from sanctions and blockades to war threats, bombing campaigns, and all-out regime-change operations. The U.S. remains the primary imperialist power, although its dominance is increasingly contested by other countries that are merely trying to rise within the capitalist order. The People's Republic of China, however, constitutes a serious threat to imperialism insofar as it works to provide an alternative to U.S. domination for underdeveloped countries.</p>      
        <p>Today as in Lenin's time, the global antagonism between imperialist and oppressed nations reverberates and structures our world and our struggles [13].</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a1s4">
        <h2>CONCLUSION: PROLETARIAN INTERNATIONALISM</h2>
        <p>In reality, it is the workers and oppressed who are powerful. We are the ones who will take power out of the hands of monopolies and turn it over to the toiling masses through revolutionary struggles.</p>
        <p>Here in the United States, it is the duty of all progressive and revolutionary people to strike imperialism at its heart. Ending imperialism in the U.S. will mean liberation not only for us, but also for oppressed peoples around the world, for they would be able to exercise their right to self-determination without interference. The Cuban people could build socialism without blockades from the US; Korea could reunite once again without threat of U.S. military intervention; Palestine would be free from U.S.-Israeli occupation.</p>
        <p>Yet our class is constantly bombarded with imperialist propaganda that aims to divide us against our allies abroad and to unite us with our enemies at home. "We're all Americans," they tell us, slyly ignoring the class, national, and other divisions in the imperialist heartland. Imperialist propaganda takes diverse forms, and many of them liberal and even "progressive." Wars are never waged in the name of resources or proﬁt, but rather in the name of "human rights," "democracy," and even the "protection of minorities" [14]. For each form of propaganda, we have to respond clearly and resolutely: NO to U.S. imperialism! U.S. troops out of everywhere! These demands are consistent regardless of our evaluation of the nation or government under attack.</p>
        <p>We have to show that workers in the United States have nothing to gain through U.S. imperialism, whether it pursues its objectives through military war or economic sanctions. We have to show our class that, not only do we have nothing to gain, but we suﬀer continual losses from imperialism-we lose our lives, our jobs, our communities, and more. By showing these truths to workers, we help unite and raise the consciousness of our class, which are indispensable to building a socialist revolution here in the "belly of the beast."</p>
        <p>While the global imperialist system has changed quite drastically since Lenin's time, the primary political directive remains the same: Fighting to end imperialist war is necessary, but it is part of the struggle for the real solution: to take power out of the hands of the banks, ﬁnancial oligarchies, landlords, and militarists, and put it in the hands of the many. We can't do that if our class can be won back over to the side of our enemies.</p>      </section>

      <h1>From inter-imperialist war to global class war: Understanding distinct stages of imperialism</h1>
      <hr>
      <div class = "publish-date">July 20, 2018</div>

      <hr>
      <p><i>This article provides an overview and analysis of the signiﬁcant changes in imperialism that occurred since Lenin published his famous text in 1916, and how these relate to the struggle for socialism. We focus in particular on the period following WWII, when the great wave of socialist and nationalist revolutions swept the globe. <a href="https://www2.liberationschool.org/the-unipolar-era-of-imperialism/">This article</a> covers the changes in imperialism from 1990-2015.</i></p>
      <p>Marxism utilizes scientiﬁc methods to investigate and draw conclusions about society, but it also represents a deeply partisan world outlook. It is rooted in the struggles of exploited classes and oppressed peoples to reorganize society in the interests of the majority rather than privileged elites who dominate all the centers of economic, political, and military power in capitalist societies.</p>
      <p>Marxists study core theoretical writings of revolutionary thinkers unlike the way religious people study the foundational sacred texts as timeless and universal truths.</p>
      <p>The central works of Marxism must be viewed and studied with time and context ﬁrmly in mind. Their universality, as it were, is rooted only in the ability to generalize from and correspond with actual historical experiences. Since Marxism also embraces the concept of dialectical change, it recognizes that all phenomena—either in society or in nature—are going through an endless series of changes.</p>
      <p>Lenin's "Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism" was a work of political economy written as part of a polemic against those socialists who supported—to one degree or another—their "own government's" war eﬀorts in WWI.</p>
      <p>Lenin's main point in this period was that the era of imperialism was also the "eve of socialist revolution." All real socialists should uncompromisingly oppose opportunist betrayals of their cause and use the moment to work for the defeat of "their own ruling class."</p>
      <p>Lenin argued that all the governments were ﬁghting for predatory, expansionist, and colonial goals. He showed that capitalism had emerged as a world system that was doomed to be involved in war after war as the imperialists re-divide the planet for exploitative purposes.</p>
      <p>Thus, he argued that war was now "inevitable" and the only road to peace was to overthrow the capitalist order and replace it with socialism.</p>
      <p>In this article, we will show that the world went through a fundamental change after WWII, and for at least a certain historical period, the mechanism of war was profoundly diﬀerent than the one described in Lenin's 1916 pamphlet.</p>
      <section id="a2s1">
        <h2>ENDLESS WAR AND MILITARISM IN THE MODERN ERA</h2>
        <p>Anyone living in the United States who was born after 1990 has been witness to the fact that "their" government has been at war for more than half of their life. The United States invaded Afghanistan in October 2001 and is still at war today. The United States invaded Iraq in March 2003 and is still carrying out bombings and military operations in that country. The United States led the NATO alliance to carry out a massive bombing war in Libya in 2011. The United States carries out drone strikes and other actions in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia on an ongoing basis.</p>
        <p>Leaders of both major parties have embraced the concept of the "long war" that will go on for decades. The promotion or justiﬁcation of endless war by the United States is diﬀerent from the many other wars, invasions, and occupations that have been carried out by the Pentagon and the U.S. military machine. The "endless war" is not against a particular state even though it has and will target multiple governments. Endless war is to be conducted against any entity—organization, movement, or government—that is deemed to be a target under the overarching theme of "the war on terror."</p>
        <p>The Pentagon maintains over 1,000 military bases and installations in countries throughout the world. The Pentagon also maintains strategic command centers for every region of the globe.</p>
        <p>It is not necessary in one sense to prove through either political or theoretical argument that the leading capitalist government in the world will inevitably go to war. History has shown, in fact, the political and military leaders of the United States openly proclaim they will remain at war for an indeﬁnite period of time.</p>
        <p>As envisioned by the U.S. capitalist leaders, these endless wars will be limited in several ways. They will be one-sided wars, and the bombs will only fall on the lands of other peoples. Those who die will not be from the United States, with the exception perhaps of some unlucky pilots or commandos.</p>
        <p>Despite their vision, this does not preclude the very real possibility that major wars, even with large states, may arise. NATO's expansion to the east, with all of the attending threats against Russia, as well as the U.S. pivot toward Asia is clearly setting the stage for the possibility of large-scale wars with both Russia and China. Even though the prospect of such a global conﬂict seems like utter madness—and from a human point of view, of course, it would be— so too did WWI and WWII.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a2s2">
        <h2>THE DEBATE ABOUT WAR AND MILITARISM</h2>
        <p>Although it seems obvious now that imperialist war is inevitable and endless, especially because the leaders of the most powerful imperialist country proclaim it, the issue of the inevitability of war has been the subject of major debates and controversies within the socialist and communist movements. Underneath these debates, at the root of the polemics, have been fundamentally diﬀerent political orientations of distinct tendencies, trends, factions, and organizations toward imperialism and militarism.</p>
        <p>The ﬁerce political debates over the topic of the "inevitability of war" issue was a point of division during WWI, which split the existing communist movement at that time into two warring camps: one grouped around the Second International (socialist) and another grouped around the Third International (communist).</p>
        <p>It also became a major point of contention in the polemics between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and the Communist Party of China (CCP). Both the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Communist Party used Lenin's thesis on imperialism and war as a point of reference for their opposing positions in the 1960s.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a2s3">
        <h2>WHAT MADE WAR INEVITABLE UNDER CAPITALISM</h2>
        <p>Lenin's thesis outlined in "Imperialism" argues that war is an inevitable and dominating feature of modern-day capitalism. At the core of Lenin's argument is that the evolution of capitalism into its monopoly phase resulted in the almost complete division of the planet between a handful of imperialist countries into competing spheres of inﬂuence and colonies. This situation would compel the imperialists to go to war against each other in an eﬀort to acquire new markets and raw materials. Lenin used the economic data at hand to demonstrate that each of the capitalist monopolies, dominant ﬁnancial oligarchies, and biggest banks would relentlessly seek new areas to which they could export surplus capital. Since no region of the planet was available and since one or another of the imperialists had already come to dominate each area, then the competing imperialist entities represented by their own governments would be compelled eventually to settle the question through the force of arms.</p>
        <p>Lenin argued that this latest stage-or "highest stage"-of capitalism swept every advanced capitalist country into the whirlwind of military expansionism. Some led the way, others were dragged into the fray, but none could avoid the phenomena. There was no road to peace or possibility of a protracted peace. War was now a systemic and inevitable feature of the global socioeconomic order that had come to dominate the planet.</p>
        <p>The theoretical conclusion from this was clear: The only road to peace, to a sustainable peace, was through the liquidation of the capitalist system itself. And the political implication of this conclusion was that the communist and socialist parties in each of the respective countries should use the war-andthe crisis and dislocation that came from war-as a springboard for the overthrow of the capitalist ruling class within their country.</p>
        <p>Other socialists, in fact the majority of socialists at that time (1916), took the position that war was a policy rather than a fundamental and inevitable feature of modern-day capitalism.</p>
        <p>The Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) studies Lenin's pamphlet and uses its fundamental arguments as the underpinning of our position on imperialism and war. But the nature of imperialism and some of its principal characteristics and important features of imperialist economy and politics have gone through dramatic changes since 1916 when Lenin wrote his pamphlet.</p>
        <p>If Lenin were to write the pamphlet today, he would undoubtedly assess and analyze the changes that have taken place. While retaining its core validity, certain parts of the pamphlet are today antiquated because of the dramatic changes in the global social and economic order.</p>
        <p>The most dramatic change is that the large part of the world that had been colonized by the imperialist powers of Europe and the United States are now independent.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a2s4">
        <h2>THE CENTRALITY OF COLONIALISM TO LENIN'S THESIS</h2>
        <p>Before examining the contemporary features of imperialism in the post-colonial world—a world that emerged only after WWII (1945-1980)—it is important to understand how central in Lenin's original thesis in "Imperialism" was the tempestuous growth of colonialism in the second half of the 19th century and in the ﬁrst decades of the 20th century. Lenin wrote:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:15px">For Great Britain, the period of the enormous expansion of colonial conquests was that between 1860 and 1880, and it was also very considerable in the last twenty years of the nineteenth century. For France and Germany this period falls precisely in these twenty years. We saw above that the development of pre-monopoly capitalism, of capitalism in which free competition was predominant, reached its limit in the 1860s and 1870s. We now see that it is precisely after that period that the tremendous "boom" in colonial conquests begins, and that the struggle for the territorial division of the world becomes extraordinarily sharp. It is beyond doubt, therefore, that capitalism's transition to the stage of monopoly capitalism, to ﬁnance capital, is connected with the intensiﬁcation of the struggle for the partitioning of the world.</p>
        <p>Before this global boom in colonial expansion, the ruling classes of Europe seriously debated the issue of whether to pursue a colonial policy. Many argued that colonial rule was an unnecessary burden. Lenin wrote:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:15px">…in the most ﬂourishing period of free competition in Great Britain, i.e., 1840-1860, the leading British bourgeois politicians were opposed to colonial policy and were of the opinion that the liberation of the colonies, the complete separation from Britain was inevitable and desirable.<br>Disraeli, a statesman who is generally inclined towards imperialism declared: "the colonies are millstones around our necks." But at the end of the 19th century the heroes of the hour in England were Cecil Rhodes and Joseph Chamberlain, who openly advocated imperialism and applying the imperialist policy in the most cynical manner.</p>
        <p>Cecil Rhodes was an ardent racist and arch-imperialist, whose political views corresponded to the obvious systemic need to export capital, acquire new territories and access to raw materials not only for Great Britain but for each of the respective imperial powers. Rhodes declared in 1895:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:15px">I was in the East End of London (a working-class quarter) yesterday and attended a meeting of the unemployed. I listened to the wild speeches, which were just a cry for 'bread! bread!' and on my way home I pondered over the scene and I became more than ever convinced of the importance of imperialism…. My cherished idea is a solution for the social problem, i.e., in order to save the 40,000,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom from a bloody civil war, we colonial statesmen must acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to provide new markets for the goods produced in the factories and mines. The Empire, as I have always said, is a bread and butter question. If you want to avoid civil war, you must become imperialists.

        <h2>IMPERIALISM: FROM POLICY TO SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>Emphasizing the centrality of the transformation of colonialism from "policy" to "system," Lenin quotes French bourgeois historian E. Driault's book "Political and Social Problems at the End of the 19th Century," in chapter VI of "Imperialism":</p>
        <p style="margin-left:15px">During the past few years, all the free territory of the globe, with the exception of China, has been occupied by the powers of Europe and North America…The nations which have not yet made provision for themselves run the risk of never receiving their share and never participating in the tremendous exploitation of the group globe which will be one of the most essential features of the next century. That is why all Europe and America have lately been aﬄicted with the fever of colonial expansion, of "imperialism."</p>
        <p>The scramble between the imperialists to re-divide and re-partition colonial possessions was evident everywhere. The U.S. capitalist ruling class, which had primarily focused on its westward expansion across the vast territories in North America, with its attendant theft of Mexican lands and the lands and territories of the Native populations, also joined the bandwagon of gaining foreign colonies around the same time.</p>
        <p>In 1898, under the guise of helping Cuba gain independence, U.S. imperialism invaded and seized control of Cuba from Spain. It seized other Spanish colonies as well, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines during the same oﬀensive.</p>
        <p>In the case of China, the major European imperialist powers divided China's territories and cities among themselves. Although China was not colonized by a single entity it was subjected to humiliating foreign domination.</p>
        <p>In 1905, Russia and Japan went to war again in the pursuit of colonial and territorial conquest, this time in Asia.</p>
        <p>Lenin argued that WWI, a war without precedent in the annals of history at the time, was caused by the compulsion of the various imperialist powers to re-divide colonies, semi-colonies, and spheres of inﬂuence.</p>
        <p>Lenin asserted it would be the uncontrolled and compulsory struggle between the imperialists that would lead to WWI and subsequent wars. He stated in his pamphlet that this phenomenon was an inescapable feature of modern capitalism or what might be called modern imperialism.</p>
        <p>This essential and fundamental conclusion was further validated when WWII broke out in 1939. The same phenomena of inter-imperialist rivalry took over 60,000,000 lives.</p>

        <h2>SOVIET UNION CHANGES THE EQUATION</h2>
        <p>World War II was not exactly like WWI. The most notable diﬀerence was the participation of the Soviet Union. The USSR did not exist in WWI. It had no imperial or colonial ambitions. It tried to avoid the conﬂict, ﬁrst seeking collective security alliances with some of the western capitalist countries that opposed Hitler. Later when the West refused, the Soviets signed a non-aggression pact with Germany. That ended when Hitler ordered the surprise invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.</p>
        <p>Twenty-seven million Soviet people died during the next four years. The world's ﬁrst socialist government withstood the onslaught of 80 percent of Hitler's army divisions, defeated those armies inside of the USSR. It launched a military counteroﬀensive larger than any other in history, which liberated Central and Eastern Europe from the Nazi yoke and destroyed the existing centers of capitalist government rule in those areas.</p>
        <p>In spite of its terrible losses, the Soviet Union's world standing emerged much stronger as a result of WWII. This was a great shock to the U.S. and British imperialist leaders who in 1941 had anticipated that the Soviet Union would quickly fall to the German war machine. While functioning as military allies of the Soviet Union providing equipment and funds, the United States and Britain refused that which the Soviets needed most: the opening of a military front in Western Europe that would have forced Hitler to divert and divide his troops, tanks, and planes. Instead, the United States and Britain opened an oﬀensive in Africa and Asia (where the colonies were).</p>
        <p>But the Soviets did not fall even under the pressure of having to confront most of Germany's military machine. In 1942 and 1943, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, even though the Soviets had proven their stubborn resilience, cynically calculated that the Soviet Union and Germany, if both kept ﬁghting, would be mutually drained and weakened by the staggering losses each was suﬀering. The United States and Britain would be able to go in and pick up the pieces afterwards.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Soviet Red Army and the Soviet people defeated the German invasion and then counter-attacked with the largest military oﬀensive in history. It was only with the Soviet Red Army moving rapidly west throughout Europe (1944-45) that the United States and Britain decided to open the Western Front with the hurried invasion at Normandy. Their real goal was to race toward Germany to prevent the Soviet Union from being the liberators of all of Western Europe.</p>
        <p>Ultimately WWII reshaped the world in several ways. First, the United States was the only major capitalist power to emerge undamaged and it became the supreme leader of world capitalism. It accounted for 60 percent of the world's Gross National Product at end of the war with only six percent of the planet's population! Secondly, the Soviet Union emerged as the second strongest world power. Third, the ﬂames of leftist revolution and national liberation movements swept through Asia, Africa, and the Middle East as the British and French colonial networks fell apart. The prestige of socialism was at an all-time high throughout the world, especially among those looking to break free from the legacies of underdevelopment and colonialism. Czarist Russia had been one of the most underdeveloped countries in Europe. In the Soviet Union, socialism had achieved in a quarter century a level of industrial development that had taken Western Europe a century to accomplish. The workers' state provided guaranteed employment, free education, universal healthcare, and housing for all—social rights that workers in the capitalist West could only dream of.</p>

        <h2>GLOBAL CLASS WAR PUTS A CAP ON INTER-IMPERIALIST CONFLICT</h2>
        <p>Since WWII, there has not been a repeat of inter-imperialist war at least not between the countries that fought each other in WWI and WWII. There has not been a World War III. Nor is the world strictly divided on behalf of the imperialist countries into colonies and semi-colonies. While inter-imperialist rivalry did not disappear, an end to the frantic scramble to re-divide colonies removed this rivalry as the primary moving force leading to war.</p>
        <p>The phenomenon of endless war continued, but after WWII it was not between the imperialists. The locus of war shifted. The specter of revolutions now haunted each capitalist ruling class and each of their respective governments far more than it did at the time that Marx and Engels wrote those words in the Communist Manifesto. The imperialists, of course, had always desired the overthrow of the socialist state. Ever since the October Revolution in 1917, the imperialists had tried to, in Churchill's words, "kill the Bolshevik baby in its crib." But the imperialists now considered the Soviet Union and the socialist system as an existential threat, and rightfully so.</p>
        <p>What followed WWII was the reorganization of world politics. On one side was the imperialist camp led by the United States. On the other side was the camp of the workers and oppressed peoples based on the rise of the Soviet Union as a global power and the radical empowerment of revolutionary forces in Europe and in Asia. In the following decades, revolutionary forces swept through Latin America and Africa as well.</p>
        <p>As WWII came to an end, the Soviet Red Army liberated Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romanian, Austria, Hungary, Albania, and the eastern half of Germany. Yugoslav Communists led by Josip Broz Tito liberated Yugoslavia. In Greece, communist-led forces drove out the Nazi occupiers and struggled for power. The Communist Party in France was the strongest political party in that country as a result of their role in the armed struggle to defeat the Nazi occupiers.</p>
        <p>Asia became the center of communist-led revolution in the post-WWII period. Communist forces took control in northern Korea and in northern Vietnam. In China, a full-scale civil war broke out between the communists led by Mao Zedong and the Western-backed Nationalist Party led by Chiang Kai-Shek. Tens of thousands of soldiers from North Korea joined their comrades in China in the armed struggle between 1946 and 1949. Once Chinese communists took power in October 1949, two-ﬁfths of the world's population was now living in countries that were ruled by communist parties.</p>

        <h2>IMPERIALIST ENEMIES BECOME FRIENDS</h2>
        <p>Seeking to prevent a repeat of the ruinous inter-imperialist rivalry and wars, the United States, as the new single superpower among the imperialist countries, sought to revive world capitalism under its own hegemonic leadership. The United States set out to create a worldwide imperialist united front to defeat the forces of communism and socialism that had taken state power in numerous countries. Where the working class took power these states provided a strategic alliance with movements and countries that were ﬁghting for national liberation and independence, many of which had a bourgeois nationalist orientation.</p>
        <p>Instead of punishing its defeated enemies—Japan and Germany—the United States planned to revive their economies and restore the political power of the defeated elites in both countries. The United States occupied Japan and Germany militarily, turning them into bulwarks in a global anti-communist, anti-Soviet front.</p>
        <p>This marked an entirely new era where the danger of imperialist war was channeled away from inter-imperialist competition and into a global confrontation between the imperialists against the Soviet Union, communism and the socialist bloc governments.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a2s9">
        <h2>NO WWIII, BUT SOME CLOSE CALLS</h2>
        <p>This global confrontation between imperialism and the Soviet Union and other socialist governments became known as the Cold War. In reality, the war was quite "hot" as it led to the extremely destructive Korean and Vietnam wars, among other confrontations. But it did not lead to a new global war of the magnitude of WWII. The very real danger of a global war, with nuclear weapons, however, became a major factor in the creation of a global peace movement spanning several decades. There were several near misses when it came to such a war.</p>
        <p>On May 20, 1953, President Dwight Eisenhower authorized nuclear bombs to be dropped on North Korea and China in order to end the stalemate in the Korea War that had been raging since June 1950. The plan was not for isolated nuclear attacks but a major escalation in strategic bombing in both countries. If the Soviets intervened to save their allies then the Pentagon was planning to unleash a secret war plan called SHAKEDOWN, a "mass pre-emptive ﬁrst strike on the Soviet Union itself with well over 600 Mark VI plutonium bombs delivered by hundreds of B-36's and B-52's."</p>
        <p>During the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, thermonuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union was narrowly prevented when Nikita Khrushchev capitulated to a U.S. ultimatum to withdraw nuclear missiles from Cuba.</p>
        <p>In the early 1980s, the threat of a global nuclear war re-emerged because of Ronald Reagan's placement of intermediate-range nuclear missiles that targeted Soviet political and leadership offices that could hit their targets six minutes after launch.</p>

        <h2>NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THE ORIGIN OF THE COLD WAR</h2>
        <p>The United States had introduced nuclear weapons into modern warfare by dramatically incinerating the two Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on Aug. 7 and Aug. 11, 1945. Japan, which was already eﬀectively defeated and whose cities had been destroyed through massive carpet bombing using conventional non-nuclear weapons, surrendered unconditionally to the United States on August 15, 1945. The nuclear bombings of Japan demonstrated to the world—to friend and foe alike—that the United States now possessed a weapon of such destructive magnitude that a single bomb was capable of killing hundreds of thousands of human beings and destroying entire cities instantly.</p>
        <p>At the time of the nuclear bomb attacks, the Soviet Union was an ally with the United States and Great Britain in the global war to defeat Germany and Japan.</p>
        <p>But the United States dropped the two nuclear bombs not only to secure the unconditional surrender of Japan but as a demonstration of power to its Soviet ally. Neither the Soviet Union nor any other country possessed nuclear weapons at that time.</p>        
      </section>
      <section id="a2s11">
        <h2>HOW ALLIES BECOME FRIENDS: BACKGROUND TO THE NEW GLOBAL CONFRONTATION</h2>
        <p>Just weeks before the U.S. nuclear attack on Japan the three military allies-the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union—held a summit meeting in Potsdam, Germany. The Potsdam area had just been occupied by the Red Army in its westward counter-oﬀensive against the Nazis.</p>
        <p>At the meeting they agreed that the German capital of Berlin, located in the eastern half of Germany under the control of the Red Army, would be partitioned into four zones of occupation, as was the rest of Germany, each controlled by the United States, Great Britain, France, and the USSR.</p>
        <p>As the Cold War unfolded, the fate of Berlin became the touchstone for a global crisis and possible nuclear confrontation. In 1961, the Berlin Wall was constructed in the middle of Berlin by socialist East Germany as a measure against counterrevolutionary activity directed by U.S. imperialism against East Germany and the Soviet bloc.</p>
        <p>Between 1945 and 1948, the struggle between the Soviet Union against the United States and Britain was focused on the countries in Central and Eastern Europe that had been liberated by the Soviet Red Army.</p>
        <p>The United States and Britain demanded that the Red Army—which constituted the basic state power after the defeat of the Nazis—leave those territories and that the bourgeois political elites who ruled the countries before the war be returned to power. But these same elites were hostile to the Soviet Union and had persecuted their own communist movements. Many were fascist or had ties to fascism.</p>
        <p>The Soviet government led by Stalin would probably have been satisﬁed with having non-communist governments take over in these countries if they had been entirely "neutral" rather than acting as an anti-Soviet vanguard in countries that bordered the Soviet Union and territories that had been used by the fascists to invade the USSR in 1940. For instance, the Red Army left Austria and was able to consummate a neutrality arrangement with the capitalist authorities there.</p>
        <p>The United States, however, had a monopoly on nuclear weapons and created an anti-Soviet military alliance, NATO, which demonstrated clearly to the Soviet leadership that a new war danger threatened again on its western borders.</p>
        <p>Under these pressures, the Soviet Union cooperated with communist parties in Eastern and Central Europe to take governing power. In power, they nationalized the means of production and reorganized their economies with central planning and in coordination with the Soviet economic structures.</p>
        <p>With the exception of Yugoslavia and to some degree Czechoslovakia, these governments in Eastern and Central Europe, became socialist not based on a workers' revolution from below but from administrative and military decisions.</p>
        <p>Yugoslavia was liberated from fascism by the eﬀorts of their own communist-led Partisan armies rather than the Soviet Red Army. And the communists in Czechoslovakia were strong and helped a lead a Czech working-class surge for power in 1948.</p>
        <p>Although the socialization of Eastern Europe was undertaken by the Soviet Union for largely defensive reasons, it was treated in the Western imperialist countries as evidence of Soviet aggression, which they brazenly called "Soviet imperialism" to justify their Cold War policies.</p>
        <p>While a systematic study of Soviet international relations is outside the scope of this chapter, the Soviet Union did not systematically plunder countries to which it was allied. In fact, it oﬀered a trading and economic environment to other socialist countries, all of which—with the exceptions of Czechoslovakia and East Germany—were formerly underdeveloped countries in need of much assistance. The Soviet Union also oﬀered assistance and trade on generally favorable terms to many independent non-socialist countries that had emerged from the anti-colonial struggles.</p>

        <h2>THE KOREAN WAR: A CLASS WAR DISGUISED AS A WAR BETWEEN NATIONS</h2>
        <p>By agreement, the Allies also divided the Korean Peninsula, which had been under Japanese colonial rule for the previous 35 years. In anticipation of Japan's defeat, it was decided that Korea would be temporarily divided at the 38th parallel between a Soviet-controlled zone in the North and a U.S.-controlled zone in the South.</p>
        <p>While much of the Korean ruling class had collaborated with Japanese colonialism, the Korean communists, operating from China or in underground cells, were known for their steadfast anti-colonial</p>
        <p>resistance and commitment to the poor. Most of the party's cadres during the war were actually in the South.</p>
        <p>The U.S. imperialists were terriﬁed that the whole peninsula would go socialist, with Soviet help, if the Japanese occupation forces simply withdrew. When the Japanese government surrendered unconditionally to the United States on August 15, 1945 the U.S. government insisted that the Japanese occupation forces in southern Korea stay in place and hold Korea under subjugation until U.S. military forces could arrive and assume control, which they did almost three weeks later on Sept. 8.</p>
        <p>In one sense, the subsequent Korean War was a civil war fought between the workers' and peasants' government in North Korea and its working-class and peasant allies in South Korea against the South Korean regime which was made up of the elites, many of whom had functioned as proxies for Japanese colonialism against their own people. But the civil war became an international ﬂashpoint because it represented the broad social struggle between two global camps which represented antagonistic class interests. All the socialist governments supported North Korea while U.S. imperialism and all of the other imperialist countries, including Japan and West Germany, supported the South Korean government.</p>
        <p>The Korean War showed how fundamentally diﬀerent the world political and military situation had become in just a few years. In the Korean War, all the imperialists united under the command of the United States. Instead of ﬁghting each other, they fought a socialist camp based on antagonistic class interests.</p>
        <p>In this war the North Korean Army was joined in battle by hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the People's Republic of China, which itself had just successfully completed a socialist revolution. Although the Soviets did not enter the Korean War, it was Soviet-made weaponry and other Soviet industrial products that supplied the Korean and Chinese troops. On the imperialist side, military forces from 26 capitalist countries fought alongside the U.S. forces.</p>
        <p>When the U.S. military leadership decisively entered the war, they believed that they could reunite the Korean Peninsula under the leadership on the U.S.-sponsored puppet regime in the South. Instead, the combined counter-oﬀensive carried out by North Korean soldiers and their Chinese counterparts drove the United States and its allies back south below the 38th parallel. There the war was essentially stalemated and after three more deadly years of U.S. bombing, an armistice agreement was signed that stopped the ﬁghting. The armistice was never replaced with a peace treaty and the two sides remain technically at war more than six decades later.</p>

        <h2>CHURCHILL FAVORED NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION, US FAVORED 'CONTAINMENT'</h2>
        <p>Winston Churchill, the British prime minister during WWII, is presented in the U.S. capitalist media as a wise and wonderful ally of the United States, and a principal spokesperson for the Cold War.</p>
        <p>Churchill favored the annihilation of the Soviet Union through the use of nuclear weapons unless the Soviet Union withdrew from Eastern and Central Europe and allowed those countries to be retaken by their former political elites, the indigenous capitalists, who were the allies of U.S., British and French imperialism. Churchill wanted to move fast before, as he anticipated, the Soviet Union also developed nuclear technology and the atomic bomb. "No one in his senses can believe that we have a limitless period of time before us. We ought to bring matters to a head and make a ﬁnal settlement."</p>
        <p>President Harry Truman and the U.S. foreign-policy establishment shared Churchill's goals but thought that the consequences of a direct showdown with the USSR too risky, meaning that it might bring an end to world capitalism. Instead, the United States formed anti-communist military alliances throughout the world.</p>
        <p>In 1949, the United States created NATO which grouped all of the imperialist countries of Europe together under the Pentagon's leadership. The United States extended this new system of anti-communist alliances during the Eisenhower administration (1953-1961) with the creation of SEATO for Southeast Asia (1954) and the Baghdad Pact (CENTO) for the Middle East (1955).</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a2s14">
        <h2>'CONTAINMENT' WAS A WAR AGAINST OPPRESSED PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM</h2>
        <p>Once the Soviet Union had successfully developed its own nuclear weapons program and had, at great economic and social cost to its socialist economy, reached some degree of military equality with the United States, the United States opted for an alternative strategy that it labeled "containment."</p>
        <p>While "containment" implied a defensive strategy, in reality this was really a non-stop war against the national liberation movements and a policy of subversion inside the socialist countries. The United States treated every genuine national liberation movement as a potential ally of the USSR. They carried out covert wars and targeted killings from the Congo to Vietnam to Iran to Guatemala and everywhere in between. They staged fascist coups in Chile, Brazil, and elsewhere in Latin America. Working with Indonesia's generals, in 1965 Washington carried out a counter-revolution that took over 1 million lives.</p>
        <p>Although the main ﬁghting in the Korean War ended in 1953, in the early 1960s, the United States and its allies again engaged in full-scale wars in Vietnam and then in Laos and Cambodia too.</p>
        <p>Until the collapse of the USSR in 1990, there were many other clashes between imperialism on the one hand and the socialist governments on the other. These were smaller conﬂicts but were emblematic of the character of the new world confrontation. In fact, in almost every place in the world the new axis of struggle played itself out time and time again with capitalist imperialism versus socialism and its allies ﬁghting for national liberation and independence. No political movement or trend could operate outside this global reality.</p>
        <p>In South Africa, imperialism supported the racist apartheid government while the Soviet Union and the socialist bloc countries supported the African National Congress. The same alignment of forces played out in Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau. Washington supported the Portuguese colonial overlords while the socialist camp provided arms, ﬁnancial aid, diplomatic support, and in some cases troops for the national liberation movements.</p>
        <p>In the Middle East, imperialism backed the Israeli regime and the feudal monarchies while the Soviet Union and the socialist bloc provided support and aid for the Arab struggle. The Soviet Union also extended diplomatic and military support to the bourgeois nationalist regimes that developed in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Libya. (For pragmatic reasons—and with disastrous consequences for the cause of communism in the Arab world—the Soviet Union initially attempted a policy of friendship with Israel when it was founded in 1948, but this ruptured after a few short years.)</p>
        <p>The same played out in Latin America—which Washington had long deemed its "backyard." When Cuban revolutionaries overthrew the Batista dictatorship in 1959 and tried to retain a position of genuine independence, they were able to secure the support of the Soviet Union and socialist bloc nations. U.S. imperialism and its allies invaded and then blockaded the island in an eﬀort to overthrow the revolution, of which the socialist orientation had become increasingly clear between 1959 and 1961.</p>
        <p>In turn Cuba and the socialist bloc provided political support for revolutionaries ﬁghting against imperialist-backed dictatorships in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Colombia, and elsewhere. The same was true of the Puerto Rican independence movement, ﬁghting a form of direct U.S. colonialism.</p>

        <h2>IMPERIALIST WAR DRIVE CONTINUES IN NEW FORMS</h2>
        <p>Historic objectivity makes it abundantly clear the imperialist war drive Lenin talked about in 1916 has never disappeared but rather has shifted. Imperialism has been endlessly at war, either overtly or covertly, with the war targeting revolutionary or communist forces rather than other imperialist entities.</p>
        <p>In this wide-ranging Global Class War, there have been victories and defeats on both sides. In general, however, the main trend in the world—the overall historical tide—appeared to be on the side of revolution for working class and national liberation forces from 1945 into the 1970s.</p>
        <p>Ultimately it was the division within the socialist bloc nations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, a split that began as an ideological and political debate but later degenerated into a state-to-state struggle, which changed this relationship of forces. Instead of directing its ﬁre against the entire socialist bloc countries, the United States utilized the Sino-Soviet split by winning over the leadership of the People's Republic of China to an anti-Soviet alliance. This was fully consummated by the end of the 1970s and existed until the end of the 1980s. In other materials we will examine the Sino-Soviet split in more detail and we will examine its far-reaching impact on the global class struggle and on the fate of the Soviet Union itself.</p>
        <p>As just one sign of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's degeneration, the CPSU under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev formulated a foreign policy to end the Cold War based on an entirely mistaken conception of imperialism. Gorbachev and others in the leadership believed that tensions with the United States could be eliminated by allowing the reintegration of Eastern Europe back into the camp of imperialism. A sharp contraction of aid to national liberation movements would help the Soviet economy, and, the reasoning went, the United States would reciprocate and the world would become a peaceful place. As Washington prepared to begin a massive bombing war against Iraq, in the United</p>
        <p>Nations the Gorbachev leadership turned its back on a former ally, and capitulated to the military campaign.</p>
        <p>Even without the beneﬁt of Lenin's analysis, however, a simple observation of history should have shown the falsity of Gorbachev's illusions. In 1983, only two years before the ascension of Gorbachev into leadership, the United States invaded Grenada through what it called "Operation Urgent Fury." In December 1989, as Gorbachev was implementing policies that led to the dismantling of the Soviet state and military, the United States invaded Panama in "Operation Just Cause." With its pledge to defeat the Soviet "Evil Empire," Reagan formulated an aggressive military strategy based on "limited nuclear war" and gave no indication of such reciprocation.</p>
        <p>Rather than answering the Soviet Union's concessions with concessions of its own, the United States simply made more and more demands. These pressures from imperialism added considerably to the pressures and chaos that led to the state's overthrow—although this subject requires a full examination, which we will take up in future literature.</p>
        <p>Just as imperialism could not be satisﬁed by concessions from the socialist camp, the overthrow of the Soviet Union in 1991 did not bring peace. It ushered in a new stage of imperialist aggression and wars.</p>
        <p>As the world has changed, Lenin's core conclusion that war is intrinsic to the imperialist stage of capitalism remains entirely valid. This understanding has been central to the strategic perspectives of the worldwide socialist movement. It underscores the bedrock necessity of anti-imperialist struggle in overcoming capitalist oppression and creating a new world based on human cooperation. A world without war!</p>

        <p>The capitalist mode of production does not oﬀer any progressive outcome from its numerous crises. It cannot provide a solution to people's problems. Therefore, it will not provide employment, land, education, housing, income, and social equality. On the contrary, it is a system that only concentrates wealth and promotes social inequality and social injustice. For this reason, the IPA struggles to defeat that system and create the conditions for the adoption of a post capitalist mode of production, in accordance with the objective conditions (existing productive forces) and the subjective conditions (the people's capacity for organization). This post-capitalist mode of production will ﬁnd its name through our struggles - whether that is national liberation or socialism or harmonic living. Our various struggles are in search of a system based on eliminating the exploitation of the working class and based on the values of social equality, justice, and solidarity.</p>

        <h2>FOR ANTI-IMPERIALIST, ANTI-COLONIAL AND ANTI-ZIONIST STRUGGLE AND IN DEFENSE OF NATIONAL AND POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY</h2>
        <p>In this context of capitalism's crisis, the forces of imperialism and ﬁnance capital have increased their oﬀensive against workers of the world. They advance their attack on natural resources, such as oil, energy, land, mining, water, and biodiversity. Through these attacks, the capitalist forces increase their proﬁts as workers lose their rights. The imperialists use all possible political and ideological forms to wage hybrid wars in various regions. They use tools such as Zionism to maintain their domination in the Maghreb and Arab region. These wars are not without reason. Transnational corporations follow the tanks, taking possession of territories to extract raw materials, and force people to use the goods and services of these corporations. The military bases of the imperialist powers are installed in geostrategic places to maintain the power of the corporations and the ruling class. We ﬁght for our people's self-determination to build their destiny and our regions as zones of peace, without the intervention of the imperialist forces of the United States, the European Union or multilateral institutions such as NATO. We must focus our attention on the United States' imperialist forces' interventions, the European Union and multilateral instruments of war, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p>

        <h2>FOR ANTI-CAPITALIST AND PEOPLE'S FEMINISM</h2>
        <p>Anti-capitalist feminism condemns patriarchy, which acts on a cultural and ideological level and is part of the current system's structural basis, relying on class, gender, and racial inequalities for economic beneﬁts. The alliance between capitalism and patriarchy has been fundamental for developing a system that makes invisible the very reproduction of life that sustains it. We ﬁght for a world that puts life at the center, recognizing the interdependence of human beings, the sustainability of life and men's co-responsibility with the labor of care, and the State.</p>
        <p>A heterosexual and heteronormative family model was imposed on society to structure the system that subordinates women. This model prevents people from freely expressing their sexuality and gender identity. We struggle to change that symbolic and ideological order that upholds the vision of women's inferiority to men. The feminist struggle has proposed a reconceptualization that recognizes women's contribution to the whole of society and has called to creating a society with freedom, equality, and diversity.</p>
        <p>Currently, women's material reality is marked by violence (murders, gender violence, sexual violence, institutional violence), lack of rights (sexual and reproductive rights, access to property, education) and economic precariousness (double exploitation, labor gap, feminization of poverty, unpaid work). Our struggle is against all violence and exploitation of women. The ﬁght against the patriarchal system and for an egalitarian society, is a ﬁght to build our emancipatory projects. A new feminist wave of mobilizations of millions of women is currently sweeping the world.</p>

        <h2>FOR THE ANTI-RACIST STRUGGLE AND AGAINST RACIAL DISCRIMINATION</h2>
        <p>We affirm that capitalism has been developed based on white supremacy and racism as principles to impose and justify its domination and oppression, for capitalist accumulation and the division of the working class. The struggle against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance, is a fundamental component of our struggle against capitalism and for internationalism, and a precondition for the unity of the working class.</p>
        <p>We reaffirm and we defend all people's right to have their land, territory, their language, religion, cultivate and develop their cosmovision, identity, culture, productive systems and their social and political autonomy.</p>
        <p>We recognize that the respect to the dignity, rights and diversity of the people, cultures and populations is fundamental to build solidarity among people and we ﬁght against any manifestation of racism, xenophobia, discrimination based on nationality or ethnicity, culture or due to skin color.</p>

        <h2>FOR AN END TO THE FAILED BOURGEOIS STATE</h2>
        <p>The state model we know, which has been organized since the emergence of industrial capitalism and nation-states, has failed. It does not work. The distribution of powers along three branches of government - executive, legislative and judicial - was meant to prevent autocracy; they have failed as the ruling class exercises its power over all three branches and uses them to maintain and extend its power.</p>
        <p>For this reason, we have to debate and propose new forms of how the State should function and be organized. We have to think about how a State form can represent the people's interests, the majority of the population, and how the State form can control for the people the wealth produced by society. In each country, the people's movements and organizations must build proposals for new State models.</p>

        <h2>FOR A NEW PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY</h2>
        <p>Formal bourgeois democracies are in crisis. The republican states and liberal democracies that emerged after the French Revolution, which was consolidated during the 20th century, are in crisis, as are their parallel liberal institutions. Today, big capital has forced the judiciary and the media, and other liberal institutions to work entirely for its beneﬁt. The corporate-controlled media shapes and manipulates popular opinion, bypassing reason and fact. Demagoguery eclipses democracy.</p>
        <p>We must denounce these collapsed democracies and advance in the construction of popular democracies. We have to build new proposals for popular participation in politics, with new platforms created through dialogue and debate around reason and not fear, hope, and not hate. We must have concrete forms of participation by the people in all areas of political power, be it the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. Power only has legitimacy if the majority of the people participate in it.</p>

      <section id="a3s7">
        <h2>FOR THE DEFENSE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AS COMMON GOODS</h2>
        <p>The international crisis has reinforced the onslaught of economic power focused on appropriating and exploiting natural resources to maintain their proﬁt rates, expel people from lands that contain precious resources, and exploit nature beyond its capacity. The wars over oil and forest lands, wars over rare earth minerals, and water sources are a front line in our current battles.</p>
        <p>Capital's aggression against natural resources causes the environmental crisis we are living. This crisis has left us with ecological crimes, climatic changes, scarcity of water, land, and as the entire planet's life is at risk. These environmental crises aﬀect the most vulnerable and poor disproportionately. The biodiversity destroyed by capitalist interests leaves indigenous peoples the most vulnerable to the degradation of their natural environment.</p>
        <p>We must defend our people's national sovereignty against the advances of transnational corporations. We must defend our biodiversity, our land, and our water against the annihilating form of capitalism. We must balance what we take from nature with its rhythms. The State must democratically act to harness nature without destroying it and operate with the widespread participation of those who live in those territories.</p>

        <h2>FOR A PEOPLE'S LAND REFORM</h2>
        <p>There is a permanent struggle between two models of agricultural production throughout the world. On the one hand, capital model with its agribusiness, which operates through control over large estates, and the intensive use of agrochemicals, mechanization, monoculture, and the labor expulsion. And on the other hand, the food sovereignty model prioritizes production to produce food (and not just merchandise/commodities), with land for farmers, with respect for nature's assets and biodiversity. That is why we defend a new type of agrarian reform that guarantees land and work to all who want to live in the countryside. It has as a priority the social use of land, the production of healthy food for all the people, the adoption of agroecology, and living in balance with nature.</p>
        <p>We must also cooperatively organize agro-industries and generate employment for young people. The struggle for land is a question of agricultural production and of spatial justice. This as the workers who build and sustain urban cities are often relegated to living on their peripheries and slum conditions. Furthermore, we must value education and culture to present in all rural communities. We must defend our food, our cuisine, and food sovereignty, which is the principle that all the people and each country must have the right and the duty to produce all the food necessary for their survival. International agricultural trade can no longer develop based on commodities controlled by a few transnational corporations but rather on the fair exchange of surpluses in each country.</p>

        <h2>FOR CONTROL AND NATIONALIZATION OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, TAX HAVENS, AND TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS</h2>
        <p>We live in a historical time where capitalism is dominated by ﬁnance capital and large transnational corporations, which control world production and trade. Fewer than 500 companies/banks dominate most of ﬁnance and trade. But they do not generate sufficient employment and well-being for the people. Therefore, we stand for the public control of all ﬁnance systems as a transition measure to ﬁght the power of oligopolies, the concentration of wealth and transnational corporate power. Upholding the creation and use of a new international currency controlled by all countries, not the US dollar or the euro.</p>
        <p>We call for the abolition of tax havens and the debt of Global South countries, and the exercise of international control over ﬁctitious capital. The assets that exist in the form of money in our countries must be invested in producing goods to meet all the people's needs.</p>

        <h2>FOR THE RIGHT TO WORK FOR ALL WITH RIGHTS AND WAGES WITH DIGNITY</h2>
        <p>We defend that every worker has the right to work, decent wages and social rights, which guarantee their health, vacations, and family's future. Domestic and care work weighs on women's lives; it is made invisible and unknown in a patriarchal logic of organization of life focused on capital concentration. We need to put life and care at the center.</p>
        <p>We affirm that the solidarity among the world's workers is an essential way of life and of ﬁghting against the exploiters who are now international. Never before has the slogan been so vital: "Workers of the world, unite!"</p>

      <section id="a3s11">
        <h2>FOR SOCIAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS</h2>
        <p>The oﬀensive of capital has prioritized its return on investment, including its refusal to pay taxes. Governments that are beholden to capital have found their capacity to deliver social services to the population limited by a lack of resources because of this tax strike. That is why these governments do not guarantee social and labor rights. It is also why public health care and public education have been cut dramatically, and it is why care for the elderly, and the disabled has decreased. Public services have been privatized, transformed into commodities, and rights have become goods that only money can access.</p>
        <p>We demand that everyone have the right to work, housing, land, decent wages, food, culture, and recreation; these must be universal rights of every human being.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="a3s12">
        <h2>FOR THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION AND ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE</h2>
        <p>Knowledge is a world heritage. Knowledge is increasingly a condition of freedom and human dignity. Only a person who has knowledge can truly be free. The way to democratize access and universalize knowledge is above all through schools, libraries, access to books, culture, etc., in what is known as an education system. We demand that every person, regardless of age and social status, has the right to access free and public education.</p>
        <p>Social transformation requires us to rethink education so that it is not at the service of capital, forming docile workers with neoliberal values whose skills serve the market and where the humanities, arts, and philosophy have no place. We insist on education for emancipation, for democratic and egalitarian values. Education has to provide skills but also work against hatred, racism, xenophobia and misogyny. We must build a public and universal system of education equipped with sufficient material and human resources.</p>

        <h2>FOR THE RIGHTS OF LGBT PEOPLE</h2>
        <p>Sexual and gender diversity is a reality in all countries and societies as part of human life. That is why we defend the right to self-determination of LGBT people as we must combat social discrimination, denounce violence, intolerance, and exclusion against them.</p>
        <p>The break with the patriarchal-heteronormative model of sexuality and the heterosexual family as the only model is part of the ﬁght to eliminate the exploitation-domination pillars of today's society.</p>

        <h2>FOR OUR RIGHTS AS MIGRANTS, REFUGEES, POPULATIONS IN DIASPORAS, INDIGENOUS AND AFRO DESCENDENT PEOPLES, AND ALL THOSE WHO ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETIES</h2>
        <p>The crisis of capitalism and humanity has launched an exodus of tens of millions of people from their homes and families. They ﬂee from war and hunger for a better life. Some let themselves be carried away by the dream of "western" happiness, eager to go to Europe or North America. As these countries promote themselves as superior to others, they tighten barriers to prevent displaced people from entering - a wall on the US-Mexico border, a set of military posts in the Sahel region in Africa. In these countries, xenophobia is promoted against migrants and refugees, who are falsely blamed for the problems of inequality, unemployment, and hunger. In societies, worldwide, forms of hierarchy - against people of African descent in the Americas or Dalits in South Asia - lower the human soul.</p>
        <p>We defend all people's right to have their territory, language, religion, cultivate their culture, and social and political autonomy. We ﬁght against racism and all forms of ethnic and racial discrimination. We defend the right of free movement of people to migrate and to seek refuge in conditions of dignity.</p>

        <h2>FOR THE FREEDOM OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS IN THE WORLD</h2>
        <p>Throughout the history of capitalism, the ruling classes, the wealthy, have always used repression and persecution as ways to dominate the exploited, impede their organization, persecute their leaders, and thereby, maintain dominance. Historically, they used the power of the bourgeois State or of private militias.</p>
        <p>Today, the ruling classes also use the judiciary and the media to persecute and demoralize all those who ﬁght for social justice. That is why, in most countries, where there are popular struggles, there are people's organizations, and many leaders who have suﬀered persecution, imprisonment, and assassinations.</p>
        <p>We demand the immediate freedom of all political prisoners in the world. In light of this, we pledge to increase the visibility of the ruling class's aggression against the people's leaders and militants. Global campaigns highlighting this oppression are an essential part of the anti-capitalist struggle and for popular democracy.</p>

        <h2>FOR STRUGGLE WITH POLITICAL POWER</h2>
        <p>The institutional spaces occupied by local and national governments can be essential to improving people's living conditions and confronting the capitalist class. They also help to strengthen popular forces for structural changes in society. We can and must make alliances with parties and forces that occupy political power but maintain our programmatic autonomy and political independence.</p>
        <p>We must not forget that structural and anti-capitalist changes depend fundamentally on the organizing and mobilizing capacity of the masses, of the entire people.</p>

        <h2>FIGHT AGAINST FUNDAMENTALISM, SECTARIANISM, AND RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE</h2>
        <p>Fundamentalism and religious intolerance are instruments of division and subjugation of our people. These ideologies put rigidity at the center of our societies. They separate us and send us into civil wars of one kind or another. These are not only rooted in one or the other country. They are part of international right-wing, ideologically reactionary movements against any socio economic change, and stimulated by the ruling classes, as a way to maintain their privileges. We must ﬁght against all discrimination and intolerance.</p>
        <p>We must make the ideological struggle permanent, in order to build societies based on social equality, dignity, and justice.</p>
